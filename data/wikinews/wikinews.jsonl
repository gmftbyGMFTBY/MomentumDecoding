Tobacco oil can be very efficiently converted to biofuel, but most oil is located in the seeds, which the plant does not produce many of.\nTobacco seeds produce around 40% oil per dry weight but a crop of the plant yields only around 600kg of seeds per acre.  The leaves have an oil content of around 1.74% oil per dry weight.  The oil has previously been tested for powering diesel-fueled vehicles and can be more efficiently converted than the product of many other crop plants.\nThe team from BFL identified that oil production in the leaves was controlled by two genes: the diacyglycerol acytransferase (DGAT) and the LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) genes. By genetic engineering, they achieved oil yields of 5.8% oil per dry weight by modifying the DGAT while changes to the LEC2 resulted in a yield of 6.8% per dry weight.\n\"Tobacco is very attractive as a biofuel because the idea is to use plants that aren't used in food production,\" said cancer biology assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson Dr Vyacheslav Andrianov, Ph.D. \"In some instances, the modified plants produced 20-fold more oil in the leaves.\" \nVarious efforts are being made to find biofuel sources that are not also potential food, in order to steer clear of causing further rises in global food costs. Last month the US government anounced funding for research that used nonphotosynthesising micro-organisms to manufacture biodiesel, in the hope that this will prove more efficient than options that rely on photosynthesis. This also escapes one criticism of biofuels like tobacco; that competition for land to grow crops on will result in biofuel crops displacing foodstuffs and pushing food prices up. In November 2009 a Spanish team launched a study to determine if tobacco, as well as the prickly pear, was capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of land not suitable for growing food, selecting these plants for their ability to survive water shortages."}

He was on business in Hiroshima at the time of the first bombing on August sixth. His almost direct exposure to the atomic explosion temporarily blinded him, ruptured his ear drum (leaving him permanently deaf in his left ear), and severely burnt the top half of his body. Three days later, having gone back to work in Nagasaki, he was approximately three kilometers away from the site of the second bomb. Although he was exposed to significant radiation in this instance as well, Mr. Yamaguchi was left relatively unscathed.\nFollowing Japan's surrender and the end of the War days later, Mr. Yamaguchi worked as a translator for the occupying American forces and later as a local schoolmaster, before eventually returning to Mitsubishiwhich had since then become an automobile manufacturer. \nIn his later years, Mr. Yamaguchi became a respected lecturer who gave talks about his experiences, and publicly spoke out against the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. \nFor instance, in 2006, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. \"Having been granted this miracle, it is my responsibility to pass on the truth to the people of the world,\" Mr. Yamaguchi said to the Assembly. He went on to say, \"My double radiation exposure is now an official government record. It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die.\"\nWhen asked by the British Broadcasting Corporation what his reaction was to Mr. Yamaguchi's death, the mayor of Nagasaki said that \"a precious storyteller has been lost.\"\nAmong the family and friends Mr. Yamaguchi left behind were his three adult childrenwho have also had health issues in their lifetimes thus far that they think may have be related to their father's initial exposure.

The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination, it was discovered, although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves, or people with dirty hands.\nOther bacteria were also found in the soda samples, including E.coli, present in eleven percent of the tested beverages. Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency's minimum standards for drinking water; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria. In total, 20% of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria.\n\"The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced,\" the authors of the study wrote.\nRenee Godard, the study's lead author, and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University, commented on the findings. \"Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time. It's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress. One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria. Many of them are benign or helpful, but certainly, I don't want E.coli in my beverage,\" she said.\nGodard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda, diet soda, water - from 30 fast-food restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\"You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage. Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere, it's just a breeding ground for bacteria,\" commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine.\nExperts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube, and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there. \n\"It could be from dispensing with a hand that wasn't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine. We haven't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established,\" Godard said.\nA professor at the University of California Davis, however, said he believed that a single localised study wasn't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country. \"How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different. Some communities are more on to it than others. How much of a threat it represents? It's probably limited.

As WHO have stated, legal regulations and numerous safeguards are in place to manage possible conflicts of interest,\" it stated.\nSwine flu's impact across the world hasn't been as serious as was initially predicted, the Guardian reports; in the UK, up to 65,000 deaths from the virus were anticipated at the height of the scare, now the estimate is about a thousand, and the current death toll from H1N1 is 360. As a result, there is now a surplus of vaccines.\nDavid Salisbury, the Department of Health's director of immunisation, said that it hasn't yet been decided what to do with the UK's surplus of vaccine, although talks are underway. \"We have to keep a stockpile for ourselves because we simply don't know what is going to happen over 2010, and we know that there are proportions even within the risk group who have not been vaccinated.

After multiple attempts to fix the problem failed, the pilot decided that an emergency landing was the only remaining choice.\nOnly the plane's nose gear and left landing gear had descended. The right landing gear would not release. The airliner made a go-around as the crew attempted to fix the problem. Passenger Jim Falk knew something was wrong saying, \"Normally a big plane like that doesn't do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong.\" \nHowever, the pilot decided that nothing could be done to bring the gear down, and an emergency landing was declared.  \"We are going to have an unusual landing,\" the pilot calmly announced to the 53 passengers seated on the plane, according to passenger Moritz Loew. Another passenger, Paul Lasiuk said he was more shocked than scared, telling himself, \"You have no choice.  You're going to go through this.\"\n\"Brace! Brace! Brace!\", the pilot announced over the plane's public address system, calling for passengers to enter the brace position as the plane made a touchdown on the runway at Newark.

Eventually, the plane came to stop at 9:27 A.M. EDT.\nAfterward, passengers and crew evacuated the plane by sliding down the evacuation slides and moving quickly away from the plane. They were then taken by bus to the airline's lounge where they told their stories to investigators and waited for their luggage. Three passengers reported minor injuries but refused treatment.\nThe emergency landing caused the airport to shut down for 20 minutes, but service quickly resumed on two of the airports three runways.

The game was won after Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled the ball during overtime, resulting in Arizona's Karlos Dansby recovering the ball and returning it for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals the sudden death victory. Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt called the contest \"...Probably one of the best games ever played in the playoffs\", while Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said that it was \"The toughest loss I've ever been a part of.\" Both team's strong offenses were evident throughout the entire game. The two team's offensive totals combined to reach a massive 1,024 yards, with the Cardinals gaining 531 and the Packers 493. \nIn the first quarter, the Cardinals got out to a quick start, when cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie intercepted an errant Rodgers throw and returned it for a touchdown. On Green Bay's very next possession, wide receiver Donald Driver fumbled, setting up another quick Arizona touchdown and making the score 14-0 in favor of the Cardinals. An Arizona field goal by Neil Rackers made it a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nThe Packers began to show some of their offensive firepower in the second quarter. To start the quarter, Rodgers led the team down the field in a 52-yard drive that lead to a Rodgers sneak at the goal line to give the Packers their first points of the game. However, the Cardinals quickly countered with a scoring drive of their own, capped off by a 15-yard passing touchdown from quarterback Kurt Warner to receiver Early Doucet. At the end of the half, Green Bay kicked a field goal to cut into the deficit which was still quite large, a 24-10 halftime edge for Arizona. \nWarner and Rodgers both showed explosive passing throughout the next half. In the third, both quarterbacks threw two touchdown passes to make the score 38-24, the Cardinals still holding the edge. Green Bay began to mount their comeback in the fourth quarter. They began with two touchdowns, tying the game at 38. Warner again countered with another passing score for Arizona, giving them a one touchdown edge with under 3 minutes to play. Then, Rodgers led the Packers in a quick drive, scoring and tying the game at 45 all. The match now had to be decided in overtime.\nGreen Bay won the overtime coin toss, giving them the advantage of having the ball first in the sudden death period. However, the key mistake of the game came here. On the Packers' third play, Aaron Rodgers fumbled, creating a Karlos Dansby recovery which he returned for a touchdown, ending the offensive shootout with a final score of 51-45.\nAfter the win, Arizona is now focused on advancing further in the playoffs, as well as rumors on Warner's possible retirement. \"I don't think you every want to stay too long, but you never want to go out before it's time,\" said Warner. \"The hard part is trying to figure that out, but right now it's about another playoff game.

To this end, Google states that they are \"currently in the process of notifying these companies,\" and they are cooperating with the \"relevant authorities.\"\nDrummond goes on to say that through a separate and unrelated investigation, Google has additionally discovered that the accounts of \"dozens\" of Gmail users worldwide who are \"advocates\" of political and human rights in China \"appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties\" as well.\nHowever, he affirms that \"...these accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users computers.\"\nAs a result of what has occurred here, Google said it has already made significant changes to the security infrastructure of its users' accounts as to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\nAt the same time, Google advised individual users to use more discretion while online, \"We would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords.\"\n\nGoogle launched its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, in January 2006. The only precondition to operating in China was that the company had to acquiesce to certain censorship demands from the one-party government. When defending their controversial rationale for operating in the socialist republic, Google said \"that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China, and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results.\" \nNevertheless, Google has still been widely criticized for this voluntary censorship of search results of topics, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, movements for Tibetan and Taiwan independence, and the Falun Gong religious movement along with other information considered harmful to the Chinese government. Some feel it goes against and is hypocritical of Google's informal motto, \"Don't be evil\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate in New York City, Wenqi Gao, said in a phone interview to The New York Times, I want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country.\nIn contrast, Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China said, \"It's a wakeup call for the international community about the risks of doing business in China. The tendency has been for companies to keep their eye just on the benefits of doing business. But the risks are realThe risks are to our intellectual property. The risks are to our values.\"\nAnalysts noted that this move has the potential to financially hurt Google, which has a somewhat limited share of the Internet search market in China, which is dominated by the Chinese-based Google-like website Baidu. Google's shares fell just under two percent after hours to US$579.50. Meanwhile, Baidu shares rose five percent to US$406.\nHarvard Business School professor David Yoffie said, \"The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising.\"\n\"It will hurt their profits. They get eight to ten percent of their revenues from China,\" said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst for Global Equities Research. \"If they walk, they will eventually be invited back into China, because the Chinese people will request that. Openness always wins, but it will take some time.\"\nTim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management said, \"Clearly not good news for Google and clearly not good news for consumers. You've got to think that eventually Google figures out a way to deal with this. If they do have to shut down their Chinese operations, that they would be able to reinstate them. Hopefully soon. I can't imagine that this would be permanent.\" He added, \"China is a great growth engine for every business. It is a great opportunity for Google as well.\"\nIn response to all that has happened and what has been said, Drummond explains that this has \"led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\"\nHe goes on to state, \"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\"\nDrummond concludes his statement by trying to assuage the situation the best he can, \"The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequencesWe are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.\""}

The European Court of Human Rights deemed powers contained in the Terrorism Act 2000 denied the human right of privacy.\nUnder the European Convention of Human Rights people in the UK are granted the right to privacy, although their government felt that the threat of terrorism meant that the breach of this was justifiable and allowable under exemptions in the Convention. Previously, the powers have been unsuccessfully challenged before the English and Welsh High Court, upheld by those nations' Court of Appeals and finally upheld again before the UK's House of Lords.\nSection 44 of the Terrorism Act allows the Home Secretary to designate an area for use of the powers for a certain period. If this period was more than a month then at the end of the month then the Home Secretary can renew them. The entirety of Greater London has spent several years with the powers in effect. Under the Act, the police do not need to have any reason to search whoever they like and have the power to confiscate articles they believe to be of use to terrorists. They can also make arrests if these are found.\nYesterday's ruling was made in a case brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, both stopped outside a military exhibition in London's Docklands area. Gillan was stopped while cycling past and kept there for twenty minutes while journalist Quinton was ordered to stop filming even after showing her press card. She claims to have been detained for roughly thirty minutes at the scene, while police claim she was there for five minutes. The court awarded 33,850 (30,400) to cover the costs incurred by bringing the case.\nUK Home Secretary Alan Johnson expressed disappointment at the ruling and stated that an appeal will be launched. Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said that while this appeal was pending Section 44 of the Act would continue to be used  by police.\nThe court found that the humiliation and embarrassment of searching  people in public was a clear breach of privacy as well as criticising that the way power was authorised did not require a test that its use be \"necessary,\" merely \"expedient.\" The court singled out London's designation under the Act as an area where the powers could be used continuously since it became law as an example of why this was not appropriate.\nFurther criticism in the ruling was aimed at the idea that the decision to search could be \"based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition' of the police officer\". The judgement added that \"the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,\" with no judicial oversight. Racism was a further concern, with the court expressing a fear that the powers could easily be used in a discrimminatory manner. Four times as many blacks and Asians have been searched compared to whites."}

{"id": 84, "ended": true, "text": "Digital radio listeners in the UK may have noticed a new station on their list over the last few months with the beta launch of Amazing Radio, founded by Paul Campbell as a follow up and companion to Amazing Tunes.  However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music.  Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com.  Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid.  The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station.  Amazing markets itself as an \"ethical\" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues.  They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day.  \nPaul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4.  After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005.\nAs Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviewed Campbell to find out more.\n((Wikinews)) Hi Paul, thanks for doing this interview.\n((Paul Campbell)) My pleasure  thanks very much for asking me.  Were really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us.\n((WN)) At the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing.  Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it.  Has anything come of it?\n((PC)) Sure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules.  Its still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve. \nThe details are a bit complex, but here goes.  (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise). \nAs British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV.  According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum.  Nice. \nNot really.  In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio & TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC.  These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers).  The BBC does it for the best of reasons  to provide a public service  but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty youll get paid on the 15th of every month. Its a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong.  Here, the BBCs actions have grave implications.  And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But its kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop.  So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy.  \nWise people noticed this.  A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed.  A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created.  It tried to address the problem.  It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one.\nHere, it hasn't.  Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game.  Its launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury.  There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff.  Ill bet they have BBC Introducing pens.  It's everywhere. \nThis is, by any reckoning, a new service.  But its not been subjected to a public value test.  Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label  i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing.  This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself.  \nWhether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules.  It hasnt.  There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this. \nSo we complained.  It was a bit hilarious.  The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint.  There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic.  I said Im guessing the BBC didnt do a PVT because it didnt think it needed to do a PVT.  We think they should have done.  Were asking you to investigate, to see if you agree.  They said you have to complain to them first.  Its protocol. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite  ludicrously bureaucratic  and totally useless.   \nSo we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981.  It takes time: Ill have to write it myself, and I have a business to run.  The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it  and reject it.  (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position.  They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience.  Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity.  Either way, they'll reject it).  \nWhen they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say guess what?  The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?. Yawn. \nAll this might make me seem a BBC-hater.  Actually nothing could be further from the truth.  The BBC trained me.  I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer.  Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK.  I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income.  (Or even, any income at all).  \nThe stakes are high.  The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. Theres an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity. \nSo well do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun.  (This would never happen in the States). \n((WN)) You don't accept any PRS registered artists at all.  Why not? \n((PC)) Wed love to  after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent.  But we cant.  Theres two reasons. \nI wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal.  I said that I thought we had identical aims  to make life fair for musicians.  I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry.  But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand.\n((WN)) And how would you suggest PRS could improve?  If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them? \n((PC)) PRS could improve by;  \nIf they did that, wed sign up.  This would not necessarily be popular with our audience.  A lot of people  especially charities and small businesses  like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence.  But wed do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians.  \nMy personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work.  There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work.  They actually did that.  They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality.  I think its incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; its ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; its causing thousands of people to stop listening to music.  When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldnt it? \n((WN)) With regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes?\n((PC)) Sorry, but we dont currently release detailed figures  our competitors would love it, but wed rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune.  At the moment, because its still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options.  As things grow  and theres been incredible growth even in the past few months  we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month.  Well soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy. \nSo far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download.  The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p.  We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of whats left goes to the artist.  Whats more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists.  Thats one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction  its much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist.  (See my Blog post on this here - [1]). \n((WN)) Amazing Radio launched in mid-2009.  How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures?\n((PC)) Its gone mad since then.  Ive worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you).  Ive never known anything like it.  The reaction has been absolutely incredible  and its growing faster than ever right now.  The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback  masses of long emails from people weve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it.\nWeve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because  well, because were a bit mean really, and Im not convinced they would accurately measure our audience.  I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people.  But the best guess Ive heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB.  Thats an estimate, but it came from a very wise source.  We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But its all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this. \n((WN)) DAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year.  How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future?\n((PC)) Were not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we cant confirm or deny the cost.   Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure its worth it.  Im reminded of that wonderful teachers union bumper sticker: if you think educations expensive, try ignorance.   If you think creating the worlds first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive . try being inaudible. \nSo far, weve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word amazing into a global challenger brand.   \nThis year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast.  They understand this scale of ambition there.   \n((WN)) What are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010?  Any exciting announcements to come?\n((PC)) Fraid so. \nIn 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what youre doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind.  We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected.  \nBlimey, I sound like some corporate twat.   \nNow (obviously) it wouldnt be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance  but basically, wed like the message to spread that were doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so well launch more new programmes and more new services  on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com.  Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient.   [2].  Therell be some video and some TV along soon too.   And other cool stuff.   \nIt may not be insanely cool; just cool will do just fine. \nWe also want to do it in other places.  E.g. America. Weve already started there. Well be unexpected there too. \n((WN)) Finally, your favourite artist on Amazing Tunes/Radio at the moment?\n((PC)) Now this will sound like a real cop-out, but I never ever say who my favourite artist is.  Its for a serious reason. Im not some musical Einstein - Im merely the bloke who started amazing.  And Im merely a drummer. My taste doesnt matter. EVERYBODYs musical taste does.  One of the many problems of conventional record companies is that they think geezers in suits in big glass buildings have the right to decide whats good music.  We think the world does. Ive found hundreds of incredible songs that I love, across loads of styles of music.  Youll find hundreds of your own.  Enjoy. \n((WN)) Thank you very much for your time Paul.  Good luck for 2010.\n((PC)) Thanks very much, we really appreciate it. 2010 is going to be amazing."}

This plea was part of a plea bargain that he agreed to which would shorten his jail term if he cooperated with authorities. \nArenas, 28, was charged with the crime after he allegedly pulled an unloaded gun on a teammate in the team's locker room on December 21, which he says was a joke on the teammate. Arenas was later found to have been keeping firearms in his locker after an investigation by police and the NBA.\nMeanwhile, Arenas has been suspended for an indefinite time by NBA commissioner David Stern without pay. This action has also gained support among the Washington Wizards and its players, according to the team.\nAccording to Arenas, he stored four guns in the locker room, all of them being unloaded. When asked for his reasoning, he cited that he had young children and did not want the guns in his home around them.

It wasn't until the late 1990's when then-coach Marty Gaughan decided to play one game per year in the Alumni Gym to remind the school of its history. \"There is just an electricity, and you feel it when you are in there,\" said Gaughan, who coached the team from the 19891990 season to the 20072008 season.\nThis tradition continued until the 20062007 season, when the Redwings played against long-time rival St. Francis High School.

Three out of four bribes were paid in cash.\nAnother finding is that one in every three Afghans believed that bribery was just a normal part of society. That being the case, only 9% of those surveyedfor whatever reasonever chose to report these type acts to the proper authorities. The reports go on to say that there is a widely-held perception among 54% of Afghans that foreign nations and non-governmental organizations are just in their country \"to get rich.\"\nThe head of the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, said in a statement to the international media, \"The Afghans say that it is impossible to obtain a public service without paying a bribe. Bribery is a crippling tax on people who are already among the world's poorest.\"\nCosta went on to note that there is a \"new caste of rich and powerful individuals who operate outside the traditional power and tribal structures and bid the cost of favors and loyalty to levels not compatible with the under-developed nature of the country. Criminal graft has become similarly monumental, perverse and growing and is having political, economic and even security consequences.\"\n\"It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Afghanistan, to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole. Corruption is the biggest impediment to improving security, development and governance in Afghanistan.\" \nThis report was released Tuesday, nine days before a scheduled international conference on Afghanistan in London. There, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is expected to face criticism for his perceived passive stance on corruption from the coalition of nationsespecially the United Statesthat have thousands of troops committed to Afghanistan as part of the Global War on Terrorism.\nPresident Karzai was sworn in for a second five-year term last November after a controversial and hard-fought election during which he was widely accused of various types of fraud.

Officials in the university's Computer Services department (OUCS) say too much of the network's bandwidth is taken up by people using such services, slowing down the network for others. \nSpotify, which has more than 2.7 million users in the UK, allows users to listen to music stored on other users' computers over the internet, either for free with adverts, or without adverts for a monthly fee. While the university allows students to use its network for free for academic purposes, it places restrictions on peer-to-peer sites, where data is shared between many connected computers rather than being downloaded from a central source, as these require more bandwidth.  \nStudents were said to be unhappy with the move. One said that she was \"shocked\" at the ban, another called it \"discrimination against music lovers\", and another said that he could \"see nothing wrong\" with students using Spotify, as \"it's not as if every single person is on it every single hour of the day.\"  There were reports, however, that the ban had inconsistencies, with students at some colleges still able to connect to the service.\nA university spokeswoman said: \"The university provides free internet access for students because it's an educational resource. If they want to use it recreationally as well that's no problem unless it uses so much bandwidth that it slows the network down.\" OUCS added, \"Bandwidth that seems insignificant for one user will soon add up when scaled up to the many thousands of users connected to Oxford University's networks. It is one thing attempting to justify a network upgrade on the basis of a genuine academic requirement, such as the petabytes of data expected from CERN when their latest collider comes online.\"  \nIn response, Spotify said: \"We're sad to think of our student friends at Oxford University unable to listen to Spotify whilst on campus.

The Old Bailey, a London court, heard that Frances Inglis, 57, injected Tom, 22, with heroin and gave her a life sentence.\nTom had been injured in a street fight in July 2007 and was put in an ambulance depite his desire not to be hospitalised. The ambulance door was opened three times; the third time Tom jumped out and sustained injuries that left him in a coma. He became mute and dependant on 24-hour care. His only method of communication was to squeeze a hand.\nFrances was told that if she wanted Tom to die legally then she could ask the High Court to allow his food and water to be withdrawn, so that he would starve to death. Frances told the court \"I know Tom  no way would he have wanted to live totally dependent. I can remember saying I felt I would rather he go to heaven than to hell on earth. I know Tom would not want to live. He had lost his life.\"\n\"I couldn't bear the thought of Tom dying of thirst or hunger,\" she said of the idea of food and water withdrawal.  \"To me that would be so cruel, so cruel.  To die slowly like that would be horrible.\"  Instead she used the Internet to research Tom's condition and concluded that a heroin overdose would be the most painless method available.  A learning disabilities worker with no convictions, she concluded two grams was sufficient to kill and began spending time in areas she believed drugs were on sale  outside the local station, job centre and needle exchanges.\nFrances was determined to release Tom from his \"living hell\" and said she had \"no choice\" in the matter. \"I asked myself what I would want,\" she said. \"I would want someone to love me enough to help me die. That's why I thought heroin  a painless, peaceful death.\" She obtained her two grams and stole syringes from Tom's hospital before injecting him, but he was revived by nurses and she was charged with attempted murder. She was bailed but barred from contacting her son.\nFourteen months later she obtained access to Tom by posing as his aunt and placed superglue in the lock of his door, further barricading it with an oxygen cylinder and a wheelchair. It took staff thirty minutes to break in, by which time Frances had injected one of Tom's arms and both his thighs with heroin. This time he died.\nFrances had left a letter to her family in which she talked of her concerns for her other two sons and dog, as well as the running of the house, expecting a murder arrest. On one bed she left a photograph of Tom as well as a prayer written by his girlfriend. Police also found older letter by Frances, one of which read \"People keep saying Tom is not suffering. How can they know how he feels?\" \nShe was asked if guilty of murder and attempted murder, to which she responded \"I don't see it as killing or murder. The definition of murder is to take someone's life with malice in your heart. I did it with love in my heart, for Tom, so I don't see it as murder. I knew what I was doing was against the law. I don't know what name they would call it but I knew that the law would say it was wrong. I believed it would have been Tom's choice to have been allowed to die rather than have the intervention to keep him alive.\"\nThe jury \"could not have had a more difficult case,\" according to Judge Brian Barker, but he told them nobody was allowed to override the law. Ten members of the jury agreed, but two sided with Frances, leaving a conviction by majority verdict. The jury foreman was greeted by cries of \"shame on you\" from France's relatives, for which they were ejected from the building. \"We can all understand the emotion and the unhappiness that you were experiencing,\" Barker told Frances, later adding \"You knew you were breaking society's conventions, you knew you were breaking the law, and you knew the consequences.\" He ordered her to serve a minimum of nine years.\n\"What this case and a number of others have exposed,\" said France's eldest son, Alex, \"is a need for a complete rethink of existing laws in regard to people that have been, and will be, in the same position as Tom. How can it be legal to withhold food and water, which means a slow and painful death, yet illegal to end all suffering in a quick, calm and loving way? It's cruel, inhumane and illogical... We have a duty of care to them and we should not allow this situation to continue. It should not be left to a wife, husband, mother, father, sister or brother to have to end their suffering, and be convicted for murder.\" Detective Chief Inspector Steve Collin, who was in charge of the case, flatly disagreed. \"There's no such thing as a mercy killing in law.\"\n\"I want to say that all of the family and Tom's girlfriend support my mum 100%.

The state senator from Wrentham beat Massachusetts's Attorney General, Martha Coakley, in a closely watched race that many believe may have a nationwide impact.\nWith higher than expected turnout  despite snow and rain blanketing much of the state  Brown won with 51.9% of the vote, as Coakley lagged behind closely with 47.1% of the vote in a state generally considered to be heavily Democratic.  The race garnered national attention when Brown came from behind in opinion polls to take a last-minute lead, leaving Democrats scrambling.  Meanwhile, Independent Libertarian Joseph L. Kennedy, who has no relation to the late Senator Kennedy, ran under the Liberty ticket on the ballot and only garnered one percent of the vote with 22,237 votes.\nSecretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin predicted earlier in the day that turnout would be 40 to 55 percent. Galvin was quote as saying, Weve been in touch with many of our city and town clerks to monitor turnout. They uniformly tell us that turnout is brisk, that interest is strong.\nGalvin added, Were particularly seeing a high level of interest in some of the suburban communities. Traditionally cities tend to vote somewhat later. But we have seen a number of communities (with) lines, and people standing in lines, very patiently, in the snow. His office sent out 105,000 absentee ballots.\nBrown's strongest vote came from the suburbs of Boston where independent voters, which make up a majority in Massachusetts, generally live. \nCoakley's strongest vote came from the cities, including the capital, Boston, where she won by a large margin, along with Massachusetts' second and third largest cities, Worcester and Springfield.  Other large cities that went for Coakley included New Bedford, Fall River, Brockton, Lynn, Salem, and Lawrence.\nWikinews reporter Patrick Mannion noted the turnout at his polling place in Lynn was small to moderate.\nBrown has promised to be the 41st Republican senator that will end the Democrats' filibuster proof supermajority and in a ironic twist of fate possibly end health-care reform of which his predecessor Ted Kennedy called \"the cause of my life.\" \nCoakley called Brown shortly before the election was called for him to concede to him. She then went in front of supporters at Boston's Sheraton Hotel saying, \"Although our campaign ends tonight, we know that our mission continues and our work goes on.\" Coakley continued, \"I am heartbroken at the result and I know that you are also, but I know that you will get up together and continue this fight even with this result tonight.\"\nCoakley finished her speech with a slight crack in her voice by quoting Ted Kennedy's famous line from the 1980 Democratic National Convention, \"The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.\"\nMeanwhile, at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel, Brown gave his victory speech to supporters saying, \"Ill bet they can hear all this cheering down in Washington, D.C.\" Brown continued, saying, \"And I hope theyre paying close attention, because tonight the independent voice of Massachusetts has spoken.\"\nBrown added, \"This Senate seat belongs to no one person and no political party  and as I have said before, and you said loud and clear today, it is the peoples seat.\"  He continued, \"The people, by their votes, have now filled the office themselves, and I am ready to go to Washington without delay.\"\nBrown was joined on stage by his wife, Gail Huff, a reporter for local television station WCVB-TV, and his two daughters Arianna and Ayla Brown.  Ayla was previously a contestant on the reality singing show American Idol.  Brown said, \"I rely as always, on Gail's love and support and that of our beautiful daughters.\" \nBrown jokingly added, \"And just in case anyone who's watching throughout the country they're both available. No, no. No. Only kidding, only kidding. Only kidding, only kidding. Arianna... Arianna's, definitely not available. But Ayla is. This is Arianna. This is Ayla. I can see I'm going to get in trouble when I get home.\"\nBrown closed by saying, \"Im Scott Brown. I'm from Wrentham. I drive a truck, and I am nobodys senator but yours.\"\nPresident Barack Obama phoned both candidates Tuesday night, congratulating Brown on a well-run campaign and saying he is eager to work with him on the urgent problems facing Massachusetts voters and all Americans.\nCoakley noted the President's call in her concession speech saying, He actually just called me before I came onstage to say that we cant win them all, and he knows that better than any, as he told me. But he appreciates what I did and what you did, and he said to extend his heartfelt thanks to everyone who worked on the campaign.\nBrown's response to the President's call was, \"Would you like me to drive the truck down to Washington so you can see it?\"  Brown was referring to his 2005 GMC Canyon pickup truck which became an icon of his campaign, which featured in commericals portraying him as an everyday, regular joe Massachusetts citizen.  The pickup truck was mocked by President Obama when he made a campaign stop on Sunday to drum up support for the lagging Coakley.\nThis led Brown to quip, \"I didn't mind when President Obama came here and criticized me  that happens in campaigns.  But when he criticized my truck, that's where I draw the line.\"\nSenator-elect Brown will fill the remaining two years of Ted Kennedy's term. Brown will replace Senator Paul Kirk, a longtime friend of Ted Kennedy who was holding the seat in the interim until the special election was concluded. \nThe last time Massachusetts elected a Republican was in 1972 when they re-elected Edward Brooke, the state's first African-American senator, to a second term.  Brooke first ran in 1966 and was elected then. \nHowever, the seat that Ted Kennedy held, which is the Class 1 seat, was held by a Republican until 1952 when Henry Cabot Lodge lost his re-election bid to Ted's older brother, John F. Kennedy, who would later become the 35th President of the United States.  Ted Kennedy won the seat in a special election in 1962 against Lodge's son, George C. Lodge.  Kennedy held the seat for 46 years until dying of brain cancer in August 2009.\nMany local politicans spoke about the victory, Mayor of Boston Tom Menino who recently began his fifth term earlier this month said, I never thought Id see the day when a Republican replaces Ted Kennedy. I think Scott Brown caught the wave of anger thats out there, and the wave of anti-Obama.\"\nRepresentative Ed Markey, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 7th congressional district, plans to pass the health care bill despite the victory.  Markey said, \"As Sen. Kennedy would say, the cause endures, and the dream will never die.\nRepresentative Barney Frank, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 4th congressional district, was blunt on Coakley's loss.  \"Martha Coakley was a lousy candidate.  She let herself get involved in a personality debate.\"\nCoakley was blamed by some Democratic officials for running a bad campaign and not campaigning enough for the seat, especially with taking a vacation right before the new year to the Caribbean.\nMassachusetts Senate President Therese Murray said, \"Money was the issue after the primary. We just couldn't get people's attention.\" \nFormer Republican Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who back in 1994 took on the late Senator Kennedy for this same seat in a heated election, was quoted as saying, \"When it comes to the liberal arrogance in Washington, D.C. Scott Brown's victory is the shot heard around the world.\" \nRomney added, \"Hes run a good campaign and hes made it clear that the ignorance in Washington has been rejected.\" Romney was also quoted saying, \"This is really a referendum, if you will, on the Barack Obama agenda...I think the people here in Massachusetts, in the bluest of blue states, are saying they dont like this kind of arrogance.\"\nPoliticians from around the country also chimed in such as Howard Dean, the former Governor of Vermont, a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and the former head of the Democratic National Committee, who was responsible for the \"50 States\" strategy which focused on winning Democratic seats in all 50 states.\nDean speaking on MSNBC said, \"Weve got to be tougher. Ive said Democrats havent been tough enough.\" He added, \"I dont think this was a backlash on health care reform, I think it was a backlash on Washington.\"\nSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat from New Jersey, who is the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, \"I have no interest in sugar coating what happened in Massachusetts.  There is a lot of anxiety in the country right now.  Americans are understandably impatient.  The truth is Democrats understand the economic anger voters feel, thats in large part why we did well in 2006 and 2008.\nSenate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, said \"Theres a reason the nation was focused on this race.

It is exactly this kind of irresponsibility that makes clear reform is necessary.\"\nObama's two key proposals were to limit the types of operations that a bank may undertake and to limit the size of the largest financial firms.\nUnder the proposals banks would be prevented from owning or investing in hedge fund or a private equity fund. Nor would they be allowed to sponsor such funds. To limit size of financial institutions, further consolidation of the financial sector by restricting growth in the market share of their liabilities.\nObama called the restrictions on banking operations the \"Volcker Rule\" in reference to Paul Volcker, the chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. These activities are \"unrelated to serving their customers,\" Obama said.\nAccording to Obama, the current \"economic crisis began as a financial crisis, when banks and financial institutions took huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.  When the dust settled, and this binge of irresponsibility was over, several of the world's oldest and largest financial institutions had collapsed, or were on the verge of doing so.  Markets plummeted, credit dried up, and jobs were vanishing by the hundreds of thousands each month. We were on the precipice of a second Great Depression.\"\nThe President said his administration is seeking to protect consumers and close loopholes that allowed financial products such as credit default swaps without oversight. The goal would be to strengthen capital and liquidity requirements to make the financial system more stable. Another goal of Obama's reforms would be to ensure that the failure of one firm could not take the entire economy.\n\"We've come through a terrible crisis.  The American people have paid a very high price.  We simply cannot return to business as usual.  That's why we're going to ensure that Wall Street pays back the American people for the bailout.  That's why we're going to rein in the excess and abuse that nearly brought down our financial system,\" Obama said in closing.\nBefore any of the proposals can go into effect, they will have to be passed into law by both houses of the United States Congress."}

The injuries included severe damage to many of his internal organs.\nAuthorities identified this little-known reporter who specialized in economics as Konstantin Popov. Popov was one of the cofounders of a small regional newspaper publisher and a local magazine called Tema. In a country where police brutality and corruptionespecially against journalistsis not uncommon, the editor-in-chief of Tema, Konstantin Karpachyov, said it was unlikely Popov's murder was in any way related to his work.\nHowever, Karpachyov went on to say that, \"This could happen to absolutely anyone.

Following which, news conferences were called, and before long Popov's case began to draw national attention.\nThis resulted in the holding cell where Popov's beating occurred being closed down. In addition, the deputy police chief resigned as well as supervisor of the precinct in question. The Tomsk police chief apologized. The suspected officer, Alexei Mitayev, was dismissed from the force, arrested, and is said to have since confessed to this crime. Mitayev cited that \"stress due to family problems\" is what led to his actions against Popov.\nThe chairman of the Tomsk branch of the Union of Journalists of Russia said that a source close to the investigation told him that Popov was not only beaten but was also \"tortured\" and \"violated\" with a foreign object. \n\"Hands off journalists!\" the journalist union said in a statement on its website.

He is accused of second-degree murder, attempted murder, behaving in a disgraceful manner, and negligently performing a military duty. It is alleged that he shot the man twice despite him being an unarmed and \"seriously wounded\" prisoner.\nCourt documents set a scene in which 36-year-old Semrau was in charge of a small group of soldiers caught in an ambush on October 19 last year. The Canadians were mentoring some new Afghan recruits, who were under British command. A United States Apache assault helicopter provided assistance to the group, who were in Lashkar Gah, Helmand, strafing the area.\nAfter beating back their attackers the soldiers discovered a fighter with injuries deemed to be so severe that medical aid would be ineffective, along with a dead man. He was disarmed, his assault rifle having been captured. Shortly afterwards, with only Semrau near the man, two gunshots were heard. At least one eyewitness claims to have watched Semrau shooting the militant with his field rifle. Troops then moved on and the man's body was never recovered.\nCaptain Semrau was not investigated for two months, when his superiors heard of the alleged killing.

I don't think any of the political forces in Iraq would commit such an atrocity. It would not benefit any of them.\", said he.\nThe attack collided with the execution of Ali Hassan Majid, or \"Chemical Ali\".\nEarlier this month, Iraqi security forces, aided American intelligence agencies, had barred a massive attack on the city.

Dr Alina Rodriguez, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College, London, and a team of researchers from various European universities studied nearly 8,000 children from the north of Finland; 87 of these were ambidextrous (mixed-handed).  Parents, teachers and the children themselves assessed language skills, academic achievement and behaviour.  At ages 7 and 8, the ambidextrous children had double the rate of language problems and were twice as likely to have problems at school.  At age 15 and 16, the proportion of those with ADHD symptoms was twice as many in the ambidextrous group, and their ADHD symptoms tended to be worse.  Ambidextrous children in the study also had a higher rate of language problems.\nThe number of people who are ambidextrous is unclear, with estimates ranging from 1% to 5%. Scientists do not know why some people use both hands when the majority of people prefer to use one predominantly. The theory is that there is something different in the brains of ambidextrous people, although Rodriguez says that more work in the area is needed. \nA person who prefers using their right hand will have a more dominant left hemisphere of the brain, which is the part of the brain for language skills. Rodriguez and her researchers have suggested that the right hemisphere of the brain of an ambidextrous child is weaker compared to that of a right-handed child, increasing their susceptible to problems with attention.  Previous suggestions about the causes of ADHD include the possibility that a person's right hemisphere has weaker function. Earlier studies have drawn links between dyslexia and being ambidextrous, and other studies are looking at the part that differences between the two sides of the brain play in language skills and psychosis.\nRodriguez emphasised that the research, published in the journal Pediatrics in the United States, did not show that all ambidextrous children would have such problems, pointing out that most of the children in the survey did not develop them.  \"Our study suggests that handedness is really a marker for atypical foetal brain development  showing that the brain is working in a different way to the norm\", she said, adding that other studies have shown atypical brain development to be associated with extraordinary creativeness. She also suggested that the results may assist schools and health care workers in targeting children at risk of problems. "}

This is the conclusion of Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Dunbar originally carried out research in this area in the 1990s, looking at social groups from modern offices back to ancient villages. He found that the neocortex in the brain, used for thinking and language, cannot cope with more than 150 friends  a conclusion known as \"Dunbar's number\". Groups of people tend to be limited to about 150 as, beyond that, social cohesion suffers. Revisiting the topic, Dunbar's view is that this number has not increased even with online methods of keeping in touch with friends, like Facebook.\nDunbar compared the online activity of those with thousands of internet friends and those with hundreds, before concluding that there was no appreciable difference in their levels of activity.  He defined a friend as someone that the individual cared about and made contact with at least yearly. \"The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world. [...] People obviously like the kudos of having hundreds of friends but the reality is that theyre unlikely to be bigger than anyone elses\", he observed. \nAnother conclusion of his study was that women were better at keeping friendships going on Facebook than men  \"girls are much better at maintaining relationships just by talking to each other. Boys need to do physical stuff together\". The full results of his study are due to be published later in 2010.\nDunbar, 52, has been an Oxford professor since 2007, having previously been Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Liverpool.

Cape Town has refused the vessel permission to berth for use by owner Dubai World as a floating hotel.\nThe Transnet National Ports Authority said that the famed vessel is much too large for Cape Town and that the facilites for the ship do not exist. Dubai World had hoped the ocean liner could serve as a hotel to accommodate football fans attending the World Cup and had previously told the Associated Press that Cape Town was among several possible destinations. No others have been named.\nTransnet National Ports Authority port manager Sanjay Govan commented that \"It's the length of stay that was an issue ... They wanted to stay much longer than just the World Cup. You have to sacrifice a normal cargo-working berth for such an operation.

However, one academic who gave evidence to the committee says that the proposals, if implemented in full, would cost about 5 billion (more than US$8 billion), and it is unclear whether this level of public finance will be available.\nThe Enterprise and Learning Committee made a number of recommendations to improve the rail service within Wales, and between Wales and England.  It calls for better links between the north and south of Wales, high-speed links from Wales to other parts of the UK, and light rail systems for the southern cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.\nOther suggestions include upgrading the Severn Tunnel between south Wales and England, electrifying the line along the north Wales coast, and new carriages, especially on routes serving the valleys of south Wales. Improved access for passengers with disability is another area where the committee wants action. It also calls for more decision-making powers about railway matters to be transferred to the devolved government in Wales.\nThe committee, which took two months to look over the report, said that it was concerned that passenger satisfaction with the service was lower in Wales than elsewhere. In addition, investment was needed to meet an anticipated increase in demand for passenger and freight services. It wants the possibility of reopening closed lines, or building new lines, to be examined.\nCommittee chairman Gareth Jones said that the report \"examines the long-term future of the rail network in Wales\", adding, \"The evidence we have gathered indicates that freight and passenger traffic on our network will increase over the coming years. The objective hopefully will be that Wales benefits from this extra traffic so that we are better placed in terms of high speed link connections with the rest of the UK and Europe. It is important that the Welsh government provides for that extra demand.\"\nCommenting on the report, Profesor Stuart Cole from the University of Glamorgan said that although the plans were ambitious, the committee had \"set out very clearly what is required if youre going to get a 21st century railway\". The 21 recommendations would cost 5bn in total, with the three light rail schemes taking about one-third of that total, in his view.  \nOther improvements, for example between the north and south of Wales, could be achieved at a lesser price.  Cole, who gave evidence to the committee, says that \"for an expenditure of 50m spread over three years we could get the journey time from Llandudno to Cardiff down from four hours to three hours and 20 minutes.\nThe Welsh Assembly Government will give its full response to the report at a later date. A spokesman said that a modern railway was \"crucial\" for Wales, and commented that the Assembly Government agreed with many of the recommendations.  Network Rail, which manages railway tracks in Wales and elsewhere in Great Britain, said that it would already be spending more than 1.5bn on infrastructure over the next five years, with improvements to over 120 stations planned."}

The Stour Valley and Dedham Church was painted in Suffolk, England, between 1814 and 1815, but changes to the landscape meant that the spot he chose was not known, despite the best efforts of historians and art experts.\nNow the puzzle has been answered. Martin Atkinson, who works for the National Trust as property manager for East Suffolk, used clues from the painting and looked at old maps to track down the viewpoint. Trees had grown, a hedgerow had been planted and boundaries had moved or disappeared, but Atkinson eventually worked out where Constable had stood.  He said, \"When I discovered that I had worked out the location where Constable painted this particular masterpiece, I couldn't believe it. All the pieces of the jigsaw finally fitted together.\"\nAtkinson used an 1817 map of East Bergholt, where Constable grew up, as a reference point, but found that the view would have changed not long after the painting was completed.  \"The foreground didn't fit at all, it was quite unusual as we know Constable painted it in the open air so he would have been standing in the scene. The hedgerow in his work no longer exists and there's another hedgerow that runs across the scene today which wasn't there. When you stand on the road on which he would have stood, and use the oak tree as a reference point, you see the same view. It's great to see where an old master stood  and be inspired by the same view,\" he said.\nSuffolk, where Constable painted many of his finest paintings, is often called \"Constable country\".

{"id": 178, "ended": true, "text": "PRS for Music is the UK's music royalty collection society tasked with working on behalf of copyright holders, specifically authors and music publishers.  Founded in 1914, the PRS is a non-profit organisation with 350,000 UK businesses holding PRS licenses.  The society works in conjunction with PPL which collects fees on behalf of the copyright holders of the actual recording.\nSo, if a cover version of a song is played on UK radio, PRS collect a fee on behalf of the original writer and publisher, whilst PPL collect a fee on behalf of the record company of the cover.  In a recent Wikinews interview, Paul Campbell, founder of Amazing Radio, an unsigned UK radio station, lambasted PRS for their \"barmy standard contract\" and their outdated equipment.  That interview can be found here.\nWikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviews PRS, following up on Campbell and others' criticism as well as finding out about future plans.\n((Wikinews)) Firstly, thank you for the time in doing this interview.\n((WN)) Last year, you were involved in a high profile dispute with YouTube.  Can you briefly explain to our audience what that was all about and the final outcome of it?\n((PRS)) PRS for Music was the first collecting society in the world to license the YouTube service, meaning if music videos were watched online then our members  who created them  would receive a small royalty payment.   When we went to renew the licence that YouTube held we couldnt agree as to how much should be paid and exactly what should be covered within it.   We believed that music had become a much larger part of the YouTube service and that YouTube/Google should reflect the increased use of our members' creative talent in the amount they paid.    \nThe great thing is that we kept talking to YouTube throughout the dispute and managed to reach an agreement in September which meant that the videos could be accessed again by UK YouTube users and that our 65,000 songwriter, composer and music publisher members would be paid.\n((WN)) How many artists do you represent and how much did you collect during 2009 for them?\n((PRS)) We represent 65,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers.  We havent released our 2009 figures yet but in 2008 we collected over 600m for them.   The main sources of revenue come from recorded media (CDs, DVDs etc), international use, public performance use and use in television, radio and online. \n((WN)) Paul Campbell in a recent interview with us said the following:\n\"PRS has a barmy standard contract for using their members' music online. It requires us to pay them a fixed percentage of ALL revenue from that website  whether or not the revenue is derived from their members' work. So if we had 100,000 songs from non-PRS artists on amazingtunes.com, and one song from a PRS artist, we'd have to pay them a percentage of the revenue from ALL 100,000 songs. I.e., we'd have to take money out of the pockets out of non-PRS artists to pay to PRS. That would be immoral.\"\nHow do you respond to that?\n((PRS)) Anyone using music in a commercial way  such as a radio station  is required to obtain the permission of those that created the music.  This could be numerous writers, publishers and a record label for each song, possibly in different countries around the world.    By obtaining a PRS for Music and PPL licence in the UK you are ensuring you have those permissions for over 10million musical works. Obviously much of the music used on radio comes from non-UK writers who may not be members of PRS for Music.  Radio and television stations give us almost 100% accurate reports of their music use through their own playlists; this data then enables organisations such as ours to work out who should be paid and how much.  PRS for Music has 144 agreements in place with similar societies around the world, resulting in us representing almost 2 million writers worldwide.   If French, American, Spanish, Australian or any other writers music is used we will pay the respective societies so they can pay their members. \nSimilarly a writer of musician may be 'unsigned' by that doesnt mean that they shouldn't earn from their music when it is used by others.   Many bands, writers and performers are currently unsigned but by being members of PRS for Music they ensure that they can begin earning vital royalties that allow them to continue with their musical career.\n((WN)) How does the PRS ensure that artists outside the UK are properly compensated when their music is used within the UK, such as Thai or Chinese restaurants paying their PRS dues and exclusively using music which is from outside Europe?\n((PRS)) As mentioned before PRS for Music has agreements in place in over 90 countries around the world to ensure that when music is used the right creators are rewarded.   The system  built up over the last century  works both ways and when UK music is used internationally, PRS for Music receives royalties from foreign societies so we can pay our members.  In 2008 139.8m was collected from UK music use abroad, with the UK being one of only a few net exporters of music in the world.   \n((WN)) There have been a few cases in which PRS have been forced to apologise, exemplified by the threat of prosecution and a fine towards \"singing granny\" Sandra Burt, a shelf-stacker who sung to herself whilst stacking shelves.  How has PRS moved forward from these incidents in order to ensure they do not happen again?\n((PRS)) If we have made mistakes we will of course put our hands up and say so.  For example when we were approached about the Sandra Burt case  by a journalist incidentally and not Sandra  we did give out slightly incorrect advice, although the questions were a little ambiguous.  Once we realised our mistake we contacted Sandra to explain that she wouldnt need a licence to sing to her customers and offered our sincere apologies.  As an organisation we are very quick to admit where we get things wrong and ensure they are put right.  Were proud of our record with our customers and currently have 350,000 businesses choosing to use music in the UK.   \nTo put the complaints in context we have only have 1 for approximately every 5,000 customer contacts we make.  This is an exceptionally low ratio and there are many firms who would be envious of a record like this.  During 2009 our complaints fell by 50% and we appointed an independent ombudsmen who could handle any complaints if they were not resolved internally.  As of January 2010 no complaints have needed to be passed on to the ombudsmen.    \n((WN)) How does the PRS work with musicians who are not signed to major labels, may make music available for download via their own websites or MySpace, and do not have the financial resources to protect their copyright?\n((PRS)) Many of the PRS for Music membership is not signed to a major record label and we represent creators from all genres of music in the UK and abroad.  By joining PRS for Music, which only costs 10 deferred to your first royalty payment, you ensure you can begin earning royalties whenever your music is played, performed or reproduced.  We have worked hard to license such sites as YouTube, MySpace, Spotify and Sky Songs to name a selection to ensure our members can be rewarded when their work is used.    \nOur membership team also work hard to support our creators holding showcase events, offering advice of how to get their music used as well as legal and financial advice.\n((WN)) Finally, what future plans do you have as an organisation in order to further protect and enhance your members work as new technologies emerge over the next few years?\n((PRS)) PRS for Music will continue to be at the forefront of licensing new digital and online services to ensure creators are paid.   We aim to get the balance right to ensure new products and music services can launch and develop, but that also they pay for the music they use.   \nThe music industry is changing and the way we use music is continually changing (it always has) but well still be at the forefront enabling people to use music whenever they want, and rewarding those that have created that music.\n((WN)) Thank you for taking the time out for this interview.  Good luck for 2010.\nPRS for Music Official Website"}

The executed convicts mixed up batches totalling hundreds of tonnes of melamine-tainted milk, and were among 21 people successfuly prosecuted over the contamination. Chinese dairy products were withdrawn around the world.\nThe latest finds have gone unreported for nearly a year before a provincial news service reported on the tainted products from Shandong Zibo Lusaier Dairy Co., Liaoning Tieling Wuzhou Food Co. and Laoting Kaida Refrigeration Plant.

There, reports emerged on New Year's Eve although the actual news dated back to April.\nAfter the 2008 milk scandal new food safety legislation was passed. These new laws made room for more vigourous testing and stronger recall arrangements. The government made it clear that coverups were intolerable. At the time, 22 companies were indentified as being involved in melamine-contamination in milk.\nTwo dairies recently named in state media as behind more recent incidents were on that original list, including Laoting Kaida and Shanghai Panda Dairy Co. Media reports suggest that the newer problem may have been that milk containing melimine that was never destroyed from the original discovery was then repackaged. \nThe companies involved have stated that they bought in raw milk without realising it contained the poisonous chemical. China Daily quoted an official as saying the same thing. It also stated an ex-dairy industry official had said that it was probable that further milk containing illegally high levels of the substance remained available to the Chinese consumer.\nNews organisations have tried contacting the companies involved and authorities in Guizhou province but with little success. This trend was bucked by the Agence France-Presse, who reached Guizhou's health department, only to be told the reports were not correct.\nMelamine has a high nitrogen content which can make watered-down milk seem to contain extra protein.

The case has called into question the United Kingdom's assisted suicide laws.\nBridget Gilderdale had already admitted to aiding and abetting her daughter's suicide, but the jury decided, unanimously, to acquit her of a charge of attempted murder. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Bean, had already questioned the accusation's suitability, asking prosecutor Sally Howes \"why it was considered to be in the public interest\". Once the verdict was delivered, he said, \"I do not normally comment on the verdicts of juries but in this case their decision, if I may say so, shows common sense, decency and humanity which makes jury trials so important in a case of this kind. There is no dispute that you were a caring and loving mother and that you considered that you were acting in the best interests of your daughter.\"\nGilderdale was given a 12-month conditional discharge. The case stands in contrast to the life sentence received last week by Frances Inglis, who killed her severely brain damaged son Tom by injecting him with heroin. Tom had, however, never expressed any wish to die, and his mother had ignored medical advice, while Lynn had previously attempted suicide. When this attempt had failed, her mother had assisted her in ending her life.\nThe case has brought into the limelight the debate over a person's \"right to die\" and the United Kingdom's laws on assisted suicide. Some claim that, with a new draft policy clarifying the law in the pipeline, Bridget Gilderdale should not have been prosecuted at all. A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service defended the decision to prosecute, saying that \"It was not clear cut: there was a  sequence of events and the toxicologist could not prove which of these  stages resulted in death,\" and that it was not certain whether Lynn Gilderdale had died from assisted suicide. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, says that there is a \"clear ethical difference\" between asisted suicide and murder, and that the law does not take this into account. She said, \"Ultimately, the Government needs to review the law in this area, as this case  highlights at present the law is a mess.\""}

His testimony comes only a day after former foreign office legal advisor Michael Wood told the inquiry that his own advice, that a further resolution was required, was ignored in favour of Goldsmith's. Goldsmith's account was under scrutiny because he had consistently said that it would be \"safer\" if a further resolution were obtainedsince it would have put the \"matter beyond doubt and nobody could have challenged the legality\"before changing his mind and giving the \"green light\" only a month before the invasion. He said that he had \"good reasons\" for \"ultimately reach[ing] a different view\", and called his previous advice \"too cautious\". He based his support of the war's legality on a series of UN resolutions dating back to the end of the Gulf War.\nUntil February 2002, he believed that a new resolution would be required, but he said today thatafter discussions with US and UK diplomatshe realised that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 \"revive[d]\" the authority of the United Kingdom to use force, as outlined in previous resolutions. One of these was United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which was passed in November 1990. It authorized \"Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area\" against Iraq if Saddam Hussein failed to give up his weapons of mass destruction. However, there has been debate about whether \"all means necessary\" included military force.\nHe admitted that he had told then prime minister Tony Blair, as far back as 2002, that any justification for war other than a UN resolution (such as regime change or self defence) would be invalid. Goldsmith said, \"I don't think it [the advice] was terribly welcome.\" However, he added, \"The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it.\" Goldsmith agreed that he ignored the advice of other legal advisors, including Michael Wood (who spoke before the inquiry yesterday) and Elizabeth Wilmshurst (who resigned in protest days before the invasion), who both said that invading Iraq without a new UN resolution would amount to the \"crime of aggression\". Goldsmith claimed to have \"paid great attention to what their views were,\" but added, \"Ultimately I disagreed with the views they took.\"\nHe said that an \"unequivocal\" opinion was needed before the invasion, and that this was what he gave in March, having been unsure about the war's legality previously. He denied changing his mind only days before the invasion, as some have claimed, saying that he had advised the government that the war would be legal as far back as February, and that his advice was \"consistent\". He also called claims that he was pressured into changing his opinion \"nonsense\". He said that he \"was ready to answer questions\" and intended to debate the issue with the cabinet, but was told that they would read his advice before moving on to different issues. He said that the debate did not in fact take place  he told the inquiry that he believes cabinet ministers considered it to be \"a slightly sterile exercise\".\nIn his testimony, Goldsmith also criticised Jack Straw's response to Wood's advice, saying that, while ministers could \"challenge\" legal advice, Straw \"appeared to be rebuking a senior legal adviser for expressing his own legal view\" in a recently declassified letter. He was also concerned that the cabinet ignored, or was unaware of, the caveats included in his March advice on the war's legality, in which he said that \"the safest legal course\" would be to get a new resolution, despite a \"reasonable case\" being available based on existing resolutions. His advice warned the government that he was not \"confident\" that the case based on existing resolutions would stand up in court. Goldsmith also requested the declassification of documents relating to the war's legal status, which are available to the Iraq inquiry, but not to the public.

Their paper is published today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\nThe group studied twenty years of records of global weather conditions and wind speeds. They say that beneath the ozone hole, wind speeds are increased, which whips up more sea spray. Salt from this is carried upwards and makes the clouds brighter, reflecting more of the Sun's radiation. This helps cool the Earth, counteracting the effects of global warming.\nThe ozone layer in the atmosphere protects life from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and the discovery of its rapid depletion in the 1980s caused widespread alarm. The Montreal Protocol adopted in 1987 forced countries to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the man-made chemicals thought to be largely responsible for the hole.\nProfessor Ken Carslaw, of the University of Leeds School of Earth and Environment, was one of the co-authors of the paper. He warned that as the ozone hole healed, warming in parts of the Southern Hemisphere could accelerate. \n\"If, as seems likely, these winds die down, rising CO2 emissions could then cause the warming of the southern hemisphere to accelerate, which would have an impact on future climate predictions,\" he said\nDescribing the findings as \"unexpected and complex climate feedback\", Professor Carslaw emphasised that this research was not a reason to try and keep the hole open:\n\"You can't correct two wrongs in that way. The ozone hole was potentially a major catastrophe for the planet that was only stopped by the Montreal Protocol, so we can't go back on that.\"\nHe said instead that carbon emissions should be cut drastically.\nThe research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence Programme.\nJudith Perlwitz, a resercher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the group's data were sound but she disagreed with some of the paper's conclusions. Perlwitz claimed that rising temperatures due to global warming would increase wind speeds anyway, leading to the same effects as the ozone hole.\nThe question is whether the wind is really going to slow down, and that I doubt, she said.\nAccording to a World Meteorological Organization report in 2006, it is likely to be at least fifty years before the ozone above Antarctica is back to its pre-1980 state."}

{"id": 197, "ended": true, "text": "The Iraq Inquiry in London has revealed that United Kingdom justice secretary Jack Straw ignored the advice of Sir Michael Wood, the Foreign Office's most senior legal adviser until his resignation in 2006, that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was illegal under international law. This is the first time that Wood has publicly expressed an opinion on the war.\nWood advised Straw, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, that invading Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council in the form of a specific mandatewhich the resolution the government used to support the war lackedwould \"amount to the crime of aggression\", to which Straw responded that he was being \"dogmatic and international law was pretty vague\". Wood disputes this, saying, \"Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain. This, however, turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear.\" \nHe says that it was unprecedented for the government to ignore his advice, and told the inquiry that he \"considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law,\" since the Security Council had not met to approve the use of force, nor to agree that Iraq was committing a \"material breach\" of existing disarmament resolutions. He believed that regime change was the reason for the British interest in the nation, and that it was not a valid reason for war. He told the inquiry, \"I made it clear that, in my view, the draft that they were working toward did not authorize the use of force without a further decision of the Security Council\". Recently declassified letters prove that Wood raised these concerns directly with Jack Straw. \nIn one of these letters, dated January 24, 2003, Wood said that the \"UK cannot lawfully use force in Iraq in ensuring compliance\" with UN resolutions (including resolution 1441, which gave Saddam Hussein a \"final opportunity\" to comply with the UN's mandates on weapons of mass destruction by November 2002). In his reply, Straw \"noted\", but \"did not accept\" Wood's advice. Straw said he was \"as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations\". He also said that \"it is an uncertain field. In this case, the issue is an arguable one, capable of honestly and reasonably held differences of view.\" He said he wanted a new UN resolution \"for political reasons\", but said that there was a \"strong case\" that existing resolutions would \"provide a sufficient basis in international law to justify military action\".\nInstead of following Wood's advice, government ministers used the advice of Lord Goldsmith, who was then the Attorney General for England and Wales. Goldsmithwho is scheduled to appear before the Inquiry this Wednesdayadvised Straw that a second UN resolution would not be required to invade, based on a series of UN resolutions reaching back to the end of the Gulf War, despite having told the prime ministeronly then days beforeto wait for another UN resolution, the passing of which they had pushed other Security Council members for in the weeks running up to the invasion. Wood makes it clear, however, that the final decision regarding the legality of war lay with the Attorney General, rather than with himself.\nThe inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, was told that there were concerns about how the decision was made among the Foreign Office's senior legal advisors. Elizabeth Wilmshurst, then Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, resigned in protest only days before the invasion. She criticised the decision-making process for its lack of transparency, and called it \"lamentable\". She also called the fact that Goldsmith gave his opinion only days before the invasion \"extraordinary\".\nWood said that Straw had \"often been advised things were unlawful and gone ahead anyway and won in the courts\" when he was home secretary. Last week, Strawwhen questioned by the inquirycalled the decision to support the war a \"profoundly difficult political and moral dilemma\", and said it was the \"most difficult\" decision of his entire career. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Wood's statement \"the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war.\" He asks if the advice reached then prime minister Tony Blair or Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, \"And if not, why not?\"\nWood's statement is expected to cause problems for Tony Blair when he appears before the inquiry on Friday. The war has provoked protests, and much outrage among politicians who believe that Blair was wrong to support then United States President George W. Bush by sending 45,000 British soldiers179 of whom died in combatto fight in Iraq. The Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday, and Gordon Brown, the current prime minister, is scheduled before the general election (which is expected to occur in May). Brown said yesterday that he \"think[s] the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary so that Iraq could recover quickly after Saddam Hussein fell,\" and is expected to come under fire from the inquiry, which he himself set up, for his role in the war."}

The cards were examined by Dr. Markus Kuhn. When the layers of the card were peeled away, it was found that cards contained nothing but RFID security tags.\n\"There is nothing to program in these cards. There is no memory. There is no microcontroller. There is no way any form of information can be stored,\" said Kuhn. Adding, \"These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you can get that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card.\"\nThe device along with several others has been previously tested by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. The test concluded that \"none have ever performed better than random chance. The United States Department of Justice has warned law enforcement agencies against buying the device.\nThe device first came to light in November of 2009, by The New York Times after an increasing amount of car bomb attacks were occurring in Iraq, including the devastating bombing on October 25, 2009, that killed 155. The bombers drove through checkpoints that were equipped with the ADE 651. However, the American magician and skeptic James Randi has been skeptical of the devices since at least October 2008. He offered a $1,000,000 prize if someone could prove the device worked.\nDespite what was brought to light by the Times, the Iraqi Interior Ministry stood by the device. Major General Jehad al-Jabiri, who is the head of the Ministry of the Interiors General Directorate for Combating Explosives, said, \"Whether its magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects bombs.\" \nIn response to the tests by Sandia Labs and the warning from the Justice Department, \"I dont care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them. I know more about this issue than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world,\" the general said.\nEven after the Newsnight program earlier this week, the Interior Minstry still stands by them, \"We conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we have a series of achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, booby-trapped houses and car bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was,\" said General al-Jabiri.\nInterior Minister Jawad al-Bolani even chimed in saying, \"The thing is, the instrument is being operated by a user. Not all those who use the instrument are fully trained, the user needs to be alert and adept at using it.\" The interior ministry has spent over $85 million on the devices, which cost from $40,000 to $60,000, much higher then price given by ATSC, $16,000, despite being warned by the ministry's inspector general, Aqeel al-Turaihi. \n\"There was corruption associated with this contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior,\" al-Turaihi told Reuters. He added, \"We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally in the field of explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device.\"\nMeanwhile Iraqi Members of Parliament have called the Iraq Security Forces to stop using the devices. Hussain al-Falluji, a Sunni MP, said, \"I proposed to parliament the withdrawal of these machines from service, the formation of an investigative committee and that Iraq recover its money.\" Others in parliament are backing his suggestion.\nIraqi citizens are also criticizing the devices. Aqeel Yousif Yaqoub, a 39 year-old man who was caught in the October 25th bombing, said, \"If they were effective, how did the suicide car bomb reach this area?\" Another man, a perfume salesman named Malik Farhan, noted in June 2009 that the device was attracted to his perfumes. \nFarhan said, \"They stop us every time. There's nothing we can do.\" Jasim Hussen, an Iraqi Police officer, said, \"The vast majority of the people we stop, it's because of their perfume.\" Another officer, Hasan Ouda, added, \"Most people now understand it's what gets them searched, so they don't use as much.\" McCormick said in email, \"cheaply manufactured perfumes and some cosmetics\" contain trace amounts of the explosive, RDX.\nOther police officers have been doubtful of the device. \"I didnt believe in this device in the first place. I was forced to use it by my superiors and I am still forced to do so,\" said one police officer who spoke anonymously to the New York Times because he was not authorized to speak. Another officer blamed corruption: \"Our government is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices have been used in Iraq.\"\nMcCormick still stands by the device, saying, \"I have tested it in practice and it works effectively and 100% reliably.\" McCormick also talked to the The Times of London saying, \"We have been dealing with doubters for ten years. One of the  problems we have is that the machine does look a little primitive. We are  working on a new model that has flashing lights.\" However, an associate of ATSC, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of possible retaliation, said, \"Everyone at ATSC knew there was nothing inside the ADE 651.\" "}

This is mainly used by American troops which train Afghan security forces.\nCamp Phoenix is often attacked by insurgents, particularly suicide bombers. In mid-November, an attack in Camp Phoenix, injured 25 people, half of them American soldiers.\nThe Taliban was the group that claimed responsibility for the attack.

Sabrina D. Foster, said that a statement would be issued soon but that in the meantime she could confirm only eight United States personnel with minor wounds. According to Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman, three of those injured were American interpreters.\nSayed Abdul Ghafar, head of the criminal investigation, Kabul police, said the explosion demolished at least eleven civilian vehicles in the adjoining area. Eight were wounded, most of whom were day laborers who generally would be leaving the base after a day's work. All were reported to be stable by Interior Ministry spokesman, Zemary Bashary.\n\"The target of the suicide attacker seemed to be foreign forces, but we couldnt see any American vehicle damaged there because the road was blocked by American forces. We dont know exactly the casualties among the foreign forces,\" said Ghafar.\nThe American troops soon blocked the area, and barred access to the highway. \"They wont even let the Afghan National Police near it,\" said an Afghan policeman near the place where the attack occurred.\nIt was the first suicide bombing in Kabul since January 18. In the previous attack, several bombs had been detonated by the attackers, who also fought with Afghan commandos. The situation was brought under control soon; however five people were killed. Earlier today, Afghan intelligence officials provided another statement about this attack; this statement is probably the one with most details.\nDuring a news conference, they showed a video which was about an Afghan man arrested for allegedly assisting in the attack. In the video, the man, named Kamaluddin, claimed that he received his orders from the Haqqani network. The latter is a militant organization based in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area. He calmly clarified that he had housed the seven attackers before the attack and had provided them with several weapons."}

The group estimated that the airline industry lost a total of US$11 billion in 2009 last year, and will lose another $5.6 billion in 2010.\nAirlines in Africa had the biggest passenger demand drop, at 6.8%; North American airlines and Asian carriers had demand go down 5.8%. European airlines saw a drop of 5%. Middle Eastern and Latin American carriers, however, had rises in demand, with gains of 11.3% and 0.3%, respectively. According to the Agence France-Presse news agency, part of the reason Middle Eastern carriers performed better is because of their position between Asia, Africa, and Europe, resulting in more connecting flights through hubs.\n\"While both North American and European carriers saw demand improvements in the first half of the year, the second half was basically flat,\" said IATA.\nIATA represents 230 airlines, accounting for 90% of scheduled air traffic, although some budget carriers are not included.\nThe IATA boss said that, although the worst appeared to be over due to the global economic recovery airlines would have to keep their costs low. \"Revenue improvements will be at a much slower pace than the demand growth that we are starting to see,\" he noted.\n\"Profitability will be even slower to recover and airlines will lose an expected 5.6 billion dollars in 2010. The industry starts 2010 with some enormous challenges. The worst is behind us, but it's not time to celebrate. Adjusting to 2.5 to 3.5 years of lost growth means that airlines face another spartan year, focused on matching capacity carefully to demand and controlling costs,\" Bisignani continued.\nCosts for security were also an issue. Bisignani said: \"Governments and industry are aligned in the priority that we place on security. But the cost of security is also an issue. Globally, airlines spend US$5.9 billion a year on what are essentially measures concerned with national security. This is the responsibility of governments, and they should be picking up the bill.\" \nAnalysts, however, say that cost cutting measures, intended to attract more customers, would also harm airline profits. Saj Ahmad, an independent airline analyst, commented: \"Continued fare wars between airlines mean that yields and profitability will be low. Airlines are struggling to fill their airplanes and discounted ticketing has done little to alleviate the pressures on their costs,\" as quoted by the BBC.\n\"Capacity has come out of the global airline system, but until a few airlines perhaps exit the industry through bankruptcy or mergers, there is still a very long road until we see serious stability, let alone growth,\" Ahmad added."}

Delegates present at the conference were from twenty countries, including Yemen, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \nThe conference was called by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown due to the failed Christmas Day plot to blow up a US plane, for which al-Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility. However, the attendees stress that the al-Qaeda presence is not Yemen's only problem, and that it cannot be solved without first dealing with the others.\nHillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, said that bringing peace to Yemen and making it more stable is a major priority for the United States. She said that the United States had signed a three-year agreement on security development in Yemen. \"To help the people of Yemen, wethe international communitycan and must do more. And so must the Yemeni government,\" she said. \nClinton said that she does not believe that military action would be enough to solve Yemen's problems, and that corruption must be combated as well as building up democratic institutions and promoting human rights. She asked that the government of Yemen begin its proposed ten-point program for the development of these areas and to reduce the influence of extremist organisations.\nYemen is the poorest nation in the Arab world, and its economy was also on the meeting's agenda. The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary David Miliband chaired the talks, and said that the Yemeni government had pledged to begin an attempt to combat this by entering into discussions with the International Monetary Fund, representatives of which were present at the conference, in order to put together a plan for its economy. \nMiliband also announced that a \"Friends of Yemen\" organisation was to be launched, to discuss the economy, government, and judicial process of Yemen. Also present were delegates from the United Nations, European Union, and World Bank. Miliband acknowledged that the solution was not simply a military one by saying at a press conference, \"It's been a common feature of every contribution that we have heard today that the assault on Yemen's problems cannot begin and end with its security challenges and its counter-terrorism strategy. In tackling terrorism it is vital to tackle its root causes. In Yemen's case these are manifoldeconomic, social and political\".\nAli Mujawar, the Prime Minister of Yemen, received this support warmly, but said that any attack on the nation's sovereignty would be considered \"unacceptable\", and that it should not be portrayed as a failing nation, despite a multitude of problems, including its damaged economy, rapidly growing population, and shrinking oil reserves, as well as the beginning of a drought and its problems with insurgents, such as al-Qaeda terrorists. British Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis echoed Mujawar's statements by saying that Yemen is \"not a failed state\", but \"an incredibly fragile state\". Lewis also said that \"[s]upporting the government of Yemen is crucial to the stability of that country but it is also crucial to the stability of the world\".\nYemen's Foreign Minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, asked the delegates at the conference for \"international support to build infrastructure, combat poverty and create jobs, as well as support in combating terrorism\". However, he said that the idea of having US military bases in Yemen was \"inconceivable\".\nArab League secretary general Amr Moussa is unsure how useful the meeting will be. He expressed these concerns by telling the BBC, \"I don't know how a conference like that can decide something useful, something reasonable for Yemen... in a couple of hours\", and saying that it was a \"strange\" and \"very unusual sign\" that the Arab League had not been given the chance to send delegates to the conference, despite wanting to discuss all of Yemen's problems without specific focus on al-Qaeda. Despite these concerns, donors from a number of Western and Gulf nations have agreed to meed again, this time in the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, in February."}

{"id": 220, "ended": true, "text": "Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry today. He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London concerning his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.\nThis is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the Iraq War, having already testified before the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Review, as well as participating in an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not \"sex up\" the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Butler Review uncovered \"serious flaws\" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister Gordon Brown in order to \"learn the lessons\" of the war. Sir John Chilcott, the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not \"on trial\", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.\nAt the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was \"sorry\" that it was \"divisive\", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes \"the world is a safer place as a result.\" Blair said that the inquiry should ask the \"2010 question\", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if Saddam Hussein were not removed from power. He said that \"today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran [...] in respect of support of terrorist groups\".\nAt the inquiry, the topics on which Blair was questioned included his reasons for invading Iraq.\nAt the time, he said that his reasons were based on a need to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; however, interviews held later suggest that removing Saddam Hussein from power was his primary objective. Blair denies this, asserting that the need to dispose of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was the only reason for the United Kingdom's participation in the invasion. He explained that, in an interview with Fern Britton, he \"did not use the words regime change\", and, what he was trying to say was, \"you would not describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you knew now, that the intelligence on WMD had been shown to be wrong\".\nHe said, despite no weapons of mass destruction being found by UN weapons inspectors, he still believes that Saddam Hussein had the means to develop and deploy them; \"[h]e had used them, he definitely had them [...] and so in a sense it would have required quite strong evidence the other way to be doubting the fact that he had this programme [...] The primary consideration for me was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and unremitting message that after September 11 if you were a regime engaged in WMD [weapons of mass destruction], you had to stop.\"\nHe also said that weapons of mass destruction and regime change were not separate issues, but \"conjoined\", since \"brutal and oppressive\" regimes with such weapons are a \"bigger threat\" than less hostile nations with the same weapons. He said that Hussein's regime was hiding important information from UN weapons inspectors, and had \"no intention\" of complying with them. He asserted that  he has \"no regrets\" about removing Hussein, \"[a] monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.\"\nThere were also questions about why the UN weapons inspectors were not given more time in Iraq in March 2003. Blair responded by saying that it would have made very little difference, as Iraq had the knowledge and \"intent\" to rebuild its weapons program from scratch if it were dismantled. He was also asked whether he still believed that the war was morally justified. He said that he did. He also said that the war was required because more diplomatic solutions had already failed, and the \"containment\" of Hussein's regime through diplomatic sanctions was \"eroding\" when the decision to invade was made.\nHe also said that attitudes towards Saddam Hussein and the threat he presented \"changed dramatically\" after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. He said, \"I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us.\" He said that he believed terrorists would use biological and chemical weaponry, and also said, \"if those people inspired by this religious fanaticism could have killed 30,000 they would have. My view was you could not take risks with this issue at all.\"\nHe later said, \"When I talked earlier about the calculus of risk changing after September 11 it's really important I think to understand in so far as to understanding the decision I took, and frankly would take again. If there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him. That was my view then. It's my view now.\"\nHe was also asked about his supposed commitment to George W. Bush that United Kingdom would join the United States in an Iraq war, which he is said to have made at Bush's Crawford ranch in 2002. Blair stubbornly denied that this took place, saying that what was said is that Saddam Hussein had to be \"dealt with\", and that \"the method of doing that is open\". Instead, he says, his reasons for the invasion were moral.\nHe also said, \"This isn't about a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception. It's a decision. And the decision I had to take was, given Saddam's history, given his use of chemical weapons, given the over one million people whose deaths he had caused, given 10 years of breaking UN resolutions, could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programmes or is that a risk that it would be irresponsible to take?\"\nHe said of Bush: \"I think what he took from that [the meeting] was exactly what he should have taken, which was if it came to military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we would be with him.\" He did admit, however, thata year later, as the invasion approachedhe had been offered a \"way out\" of the war, which he declined. He said of this, \"I think President Bush at one point said, before the [House of Commons] debate, 'Look if it's too difficult for Britain, we understand'. I took the view very strongly thenand do nowthat it was right for us to be with America, since we believed in this too.\"\nAnother line of questioning focused on his 45-minute claim, which was included in the September 2002 dossier but redacted after the war. It states that Hussein was able to deploy nuclear weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order. This dossier also contained the words, \"the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons\". However, the inquiry has revealed that there were certain caveats involved, so the claim was notanti-war campaigners claim\"beyond doubt\", especially since senior civil servants have told the inquiry that intelligence suggested that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled.\nBlair said that it \"would have been better if (newspaper) headlines about the '45-minute claim' had been corrected\" to stateas he admits he should have made clearthat the claim referred to battlefield munitions, rather than to missiles. He says that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have liked to have published the intelligence reports themselves, since they were \"absolutely strong enough\". He did insist, however, that the intelligence that was available at the time put it \"beyond doubt\" that Iraq was continuing to develop weaponry. He added that \"things obviously look quite different\" after the war, since weapons of mass destruction were not found.\nOne of the main topics was the legality of the war. Earlier this week, a senior Foreign Office legal advisor claimed that the war would be illegal without a further United Nations Security Council resolutionwhich was not obtained. The attorney general at the time, Lord Peter Goldsmith, said that the cabinet refused to enter into a debate over the legality of the war, and that Blair had not received his advice that a further UN resolution would be needed warmly. He insists that he \"desperately\" tried to find a diplomatic solution to the problem until France and Russia \"changed their position\" and would not allow the passage of a further resolution.\nBlair also said that he would not have invaded had Goldsmith said that it \"could not be justified legally\", and explained Goldsmith's change of mind by saying that the then attorney general \"had to come to a conclusion\", and his conclusion was that the war was legal. He did not know why Goldsmith made this conclusion, but said he believes that it may be due to the fact that weapons inspectors \"indicated that Saddam Hussein had not taken a final opportunity to comply\" with the UN.\nQuestions were also asked on the government's poor post-war planning, and claimed confusion about whether the US had a plan for Iraq after the war was over. Blair was drilled about the lack of priority that was given to the issue of post-war planning. He was also asked about the lack of equipment that British soldiers were given. This line of questioning was pursued in front of the families of some of the soldiers who died in Iraqmany of whom blame the poor equipment for the deaths of their relatives.\nThe families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in the Iraq war, along with around 200 anti-war protesters, held a demonstration calling for Blair to be declared a war criminal outside the centre in London's City of Westminster. They chanted \"Tony Blair, war criminal\" as the former prime minister gave evidence inside. Blair was jeered by a member of the audience as he made his closing statement, and the families booed him, chanting \"you are a liar\" and \"you are a murderer\" as he left the centre.\nIn order to avoid the protesters, he arrived early and was escorted by security as he entered through the back door, with large numbers of police officers standing by. One of these protesters, Iraqi Saba Jaiwad, said, \"The Iraqi people are having to live every day with aggression, division, and atrocities. Blair should not be here giving his excuses for the illegal war, he should be taken to The Hague to face criminal charges because he has committed crimes against the Iraqi people.\"\nAhmed Rushdi, an Iraqi journalist, said that he was unsurprised by Blair's defence of the invasion, because, \"A liar is still a liar\". He also claimed that the war had done more harm than good, because, \"Before 2003 there were problems with security, infrastructure and services, and people died because of the sanctions, but after 2003 there are major disasters. Major blasts have killed about 2,000 people up till now. After six years or seven years there is no success on the ground, in any aspect.\"\nCurrent prime minister Gordon Brown, who set up the inquiry, said before Blair's appearance that it was not a cause for concern. Anthony Seldon, Blair's biographer, called the session \"a pivotal day for him [Blair], for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world\". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who opposes the war, said in Friday's Daily Telegraph that it was \"a pivotal moment in answering a question millions of British people are still asking themselves: Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?\" He called the invasion \"subservience-by-default to the White House\", and questioned the \"special relationship\" between between the United Kingdom and the United States.\nVincent Moss, the political editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper, criticised the inquiry for being too soft on Blair. He said, \"A lot of ground wasn't covered, and in my mind it wasn't covered in enough detail, particularly the dodgy dossier in September 2002. There wasn't very much interrogation on that, they pretty much accepted what Tony Blair said about the intelligence. We could have had an awful lot stronger questioning on that\".\nIt is feared by some senior Labour Party politicians that today's events could ignite strong feelings about the issue in voters, and thereby damage the popularity of the party, which is already trailing behind the Conservative Party with a general election required in the first half of the year."}

In the case of the latter, Bernanke agreed to the AIG matters being audited by the Government Accountability Office.\nThe supporters of Bernanke included Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who said in support, \"Let us not judge the man or the work prematurely.\" Conversely, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California questioned his commitment to all economic aspects, stating, \"The American people have the right to ask whether the Fed is truly committed to supporting Main Street's economy, not just Wall Street.\" \nAmong the opposers included Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, the lone vote against Bernanke on his original appointment. He said, \"a vote for Ben Bernanke is a vote for bailouts.\" Republican George Voinovich of Ohio voted in support for Bernanke, as did Utah SenatorOrrin Hatch.\nBernanke was originally looking to pass easily, but opposition began rising in the Senate chambers after Ted Kennedy's seat was lost to the Republicans, though Obama began outreach to Democratic Senators after the election, putting the confirmation back on track.

Initial reports suggested that the bomber was in a vehicle, and a local official states that the bomber was wearing a suicide vest.\nIt is thought that the bomber detonated the vest when security forces stopped him for a search at the checkpoint, situated in a marketplace. After the attack, a curfew was imposed and all bazaars in the city shut down. The bomber was said to be headed towards military barracks before he was stopped.\nPakistani Prime Minister, Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani condemned the bombing, and expressed deep grief and sorrow, according to a statement issued by his office. He called for an immediate inquiry. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but government officials blame the Taliban.\nPakistani forces have been attacking militants in the Bajaur region, which, close to the Afghan border, is suspected to be the hiding place of Osama Bin Laden, as well as other al-Qaeda leaders. At least 24 suspected militants have been killed in the fighting, according to government officials. \nIn February 2009, the army announced that Bajaur had been cleansed of Taliban militants, following a ground offensive launched in October 2008. However, the situation is getting worse, with numerous attacks in the last six months."}

The battle raged on for hours, according to sources. The al-Shabaab group claimed responsibility for the attack.\nTwelve civilians were killed in the incident, while 25 were injured. The Hodan Wardhigley and Howl Wadag districts were the worst hit. Medical authorities claimed that the deaths had occurred when mortar fire had burnt their houses. The fire came from both the insurgents and the peace-keepers, according to the officials. Ali Musa, one of the officials of a volunteer ambulance service in Mogadishu, said that a mother and her two children had died during the firing.\nThe attack commenced on 2 AM, Friday. Awakened by mortar explosions, residents hid inside their houses, while others left for safer places. The battle went on for hours and the sound of the firing emanated to all parts of the Somali capital.\nThis was the most intense fighting in months, claim residents. \"I thought I was dreaming when I heard the sound of the artillery,\" said Asha Abdulle, Mogadishu resident, while Ahmed Hashi said that the fighting was the \"worst in months.\" Nurta Hussein, another resident said: \"We were woken up by the explosions at 2 a.m. and haven't slept since because of the non-stop shelling. Two mortar bombs landed in this neighborhood, killing four civilians and wounding six.\"\nAlmost 20,000 Somali civilians have died since 2007, as a result of multiple insurgent attacks. Almost 1.5 million have been forced to leave the country since that time.\nThe al-Shabab as well as another group, called Hizbul Islam, claimed responsibility in a statement they released. They successfully attacked \"the strongholds of the enemies of Allah,\" claimed the statement. \"The mujahideen attacked AMISOM and government bases last night and we killed some of their troops. When we pulled back, AMISOM began intentionally shelling residential areas. We shall keep on targeting them,\" said the attackers. However Somali officials called the attack \"small and careless.\"\nMogadishu's \"Kilometer Four\" area was one of those affected. It includes a square that connects the airport to the port. While the area has been attacked several times previously, this attack is said to be the worst. African Union peace-keepers from Uganda are posted there.\nThe fighting comes almost a year since Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was sworn in as the nation's new president.\nAl-Shabaab is considered a terrorist body by the United States; the latter blames it for multiple attacks, shootings and bombings inside Somalia.\nAl-Shabaab has also threatened other African countries, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda.\nAn African Union soldier, on a condition of anonymity, said that one Ugandan soldier was killed in the clash. He added that another soldier was wounded. A Somali government official backed this claim. Earlier, on Monday, two AU soldiers had died in another mortar attack in an AU clinic.\nWhen contacted through telephone, Somalia's Defence Minister, Sheikh Yusuf Mohammad Siad, who is a former warlord (also known as \"Inda'ade\" or \"white eyed\") said more than ten insurgents had died in the clash.\nParts of the Shabaab group have connections with al-Qaeda. The former has regularly attacked different parts of Somalia, with suicide bombers and several insurgents, taking advantage of the weak political and military infrastructure of the country.\nThe incident occurred exactly an year following President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed election to the parliament. The government was set to celebrate its first anniversary with a parade and poetry recitations at the presidential palace, named Villa Somalia. It was not known whether the attack intentionally collided with this event. However, it was a reminder of Somalia's weak military power; the army was heavily dependent on the African troops in this attack as well.\nFor over two decades, the country has had no central government. This has led to warlords ruling the nation, which often suffers from attacks by militant groups and pirate ships.\nDuring an African Union (AU) summit Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, Ali Jama' Jangeli, Somali Foreign Minister, requested more African Union troops to assist other soldiers in the capital. Both Kenya and Sudan backed Jangeli; Djibouti answered the call and promised to send 450 soldiers soon.\n\"The situation in Somalia is very grim, it is very precarious. It is threatening stability in the whole of the east Africa region and the Horn of Africa. It is in our interest as a region ... also in the interest of Africa to contribute more troops to Somalia so that there is law and order in Somalia,\" claimed Jangeli's Sudanese counterpart, Deng Alor.\nThe United States and Western nations are supportive of Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed's government, amidst fears that Somalia would become a base for al-Qaeda and other such organizations. However, the Somali government controls only few city blocks in the country.\nApart from attacks on government forces, the militants have also bombed the country's principal airport. There also has been an explosion during a college graduation ceremony, claim civilians.\nWestern nations have spent millions of dollars to buy weapons and ammunition for the Somali army. However, since the Shabab group controls a significant part of the country, the Somali government has had limited success. The group has won several battles and displaced millions of Somali people."}

In an effort to regain control of Taiwan, the government in Beijing has been open to running the island like Hong Kong, in a \"one country, two systems\" manner, but people in Taiwan support the status quo.

The Pentagon proposed the deal, that was first promised during the later days of the Bush administration, to Congress earlier.\nYafei issued a statement on the Foreign Ministry website stating that \"the United States' announcement of the planned weapons sales to Taiwan will have a seriously negative impact on many important areas of exchanges and co-operation between the two countries.\"\nHowever, the US is defending itself. \"Such sales contribute to maintaining security and stability across the Taiwan Strait\", Laura Tischler, spokeswoman for the US State Department, said.\nBeijing is threatening to review co-operation on major issues and impose sanctions on companies selling arms, even though US companies are banned from selling arms to China as a result of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, so it is not clear what the effect will be. A Chinese defence ministry spokesman said that the sanctions reflected the \"severe harm\" the deal would have. A foreign ministry spokesman stated that there would be \"repercussions that neither side wishes to see\" if the deal went ahead.\nTaiwan, one of Asia's few functioning democracies, welcomed the proposal, with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou being quoted as saying \"It will let Taiwan feel more confident and secure so we can have more interactions with China.\"\nThe arms deal includes UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, communications equipment and MIM-104 Patriot missiles, but does not include the F-16 fighter jets that Taiwan's military were looking for.

Overall, the cuts are predicted to save $250 billion. There is also $100 billion in tax incentives aimed at hiring workers. US residents with incomes of over $250,000 per annum, however, would be given higher taxes, partially offsetting that.\nOther increases in the proposed budget include; $48 billion for veterans' medical care, or an increase of eight percent; $53 billion for homeland security; $310 million to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison. He also suggested freezing spending for some federal programs and departments and programs for three years, exempting Medicare, Social Security, and national security.\nIn order for the budget to take effect, Congress must approve it by the beginning of the fiscal year starting October 1.\nWhen introducing the budget, Obama stated that \"we [...] continue to lay a new foundation for lasting growth. Just as it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children's future to pay our way today, it would be equally wrong to neglect their future by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success in this new century.\"\nAt the White House, he also commented: \"It's a budget that reflects the serious challenges facing the country.

The three-hour session was held in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London's City of Westminster.\nShort, an outspoken critic of the war, retired from the cabinet to become an independent MP two months before the invasion. She claimed to have been \"conned\" into staying on despite her doubts about the war and told the inquiry that the Cabinet, of which she was a part, was not a \"decision-making body\", and that Parliament was simply a \"rubber stamp\".\nShe also claimed that Tony Blair \"and his mates\" had acted \"on a wing and a prayer\", having \"leaned on\" then-Attorney General for England and Wales Lord Peter Goldsmith, pressurising him to change his mind about the invasion. She did, however, admit that she had no evidence to support these claims. Goldsmith gave a verdict that the war would be legal only shortly before the invasion, having firmly held the belief that it would not be without a further United Nations Security Council resolution.\nShort was applauded as she concluded her testimony, in which she said that she was \"shocked\" at how a definitive statement about the legality of the war circulated only as late as March 17, 2003  just three days before the invasion began  that this state of shock led her to be \"jeered at\" by other ministers. Said statement, according to Short, contained no hint that Goldsmith had previously had any doubts whatsoever.\nShe said any discussion of legality was stopped at the same pre-war cabinet meeting. She accused Blair of standing in the way of such discussion, and said, \"Everything that's happened since makes me know that there was deliberate blockage and there were also all sorts of secret, private meetings\", and that normal cabinet communications were \"closed down\" as the invasion approached. \"There was never a meeting that said 'what's the problem, what are we trying to achieve, what are our military, diplomatic options?' We never had that coherent discussion ... never.\"\nGoldsmith responded to her inquiries about the lateness of this statement by saying \"it takes me a long time to make my mind up\", and that he had made his decision after consulting foreign legal professionals. She said that Goldsmith's \"doubts and his changes of opinion\" made her \"think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go war was misleading.\" She said that \"I think he misled the cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through\". \nShe claimed that the government, having failed to secure a required UN resolution, started the \"untrue\" rumour that France had vetoed it. She said that she \"believed them at the time. You don't want to disbelieve your Prime Minister in the run-up to war and you want to believe the leader of your party. You want to be loyal\".\nWhen asked why she had not resigned earlier than she did, she said that she \"was conned\" by Blair's promises of a strong role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as more attempts to resolve the conflict about Israel. She said that she \"thought that if we got a Palestinian state and a UN lead on reconstruction, that will be much better ... I took a lot of flak for it. I still think, if we had done those things, it would have been a heck of a lot better.\" She says that this lack of UN involvement in the post-invasion reconstruction effort was her main reason for retiring from the government.\nShort said that she \"was seeing the intelligence\" about Iraq at the earlier stages of preparation for an invasion, but that in late 2002 \"asked for a briefing... This just didn't come and didn't come... it became clear there was some sort of block on communications.\" Apparently, the intelligence reports she say said that \"Saddam Hussein didn't have nuclear [weapons] ... [he] would if he could but he was nowhere near it. It wasn't saying there was some new imminent threat\".\nShort asserted Blair's evidence, given to the inquiry on Friday, was \"historically inaccurate\", since \"[t]here was no evidence of any kind of an escalation of threats\" after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. This is contrary to Blair's claims that attitudes towards the threat Iraq posed \"changed dramatically\" after the attacks, and that Saddam Hussein \"threatened not just the region but the world\".\nShe said, \"We could have gone more slowly and carefully and not have had a totally destabilised and angry Iraq. The American people were misled to suggest that al-Qaeda had links to Saddam Hussein. Everybody knows that is untrue - that he had absolutely no links, no sympathy, al-Qaeda were nowhere near Iraq until after the invasion and the disorder that came from that.\" Short criticised the military for not meeting the obligations laid out for them, as an occupying force, by the Geneva Convention.\nLord Boyce, the former head of the British armed forces, said in an earlier hearing that officials from the Department for International Development  Short's department  let their opposition to the war prevent them from cooperating fully with the rest of the government immediately after the invasion. Alistair Campbell, Blair's former spokesman, said that Short had been \"difficult to handle\" in the run-up to the invasion, and that there was fear that she may leak pieces of information that she did not agree with. Lord Andrew Turnbull, former Secretary of the Cabinet, however, said that these concerns were unfair, and that minority voices had been unfairly pushed to the sidelines.\nHilary Benn, who took over Short's post after her resignation, is scheduled to give evidence before the inquiry today."}

{"id": 273, "ended": true, "text": "A French court Tuesday launched the trial of five men and a US airline over the Concorde disaster. 113 people were killed when the supersonic jet struck a hotel near Paris in 2000.\nThe prosecution case agrees with the facts set out in the final accident report, which, by international law, was written from an entirely different investigation and thus cannot be introduced in court. It alleges that improper maintenance of an American airliner and failure to detect design flaws with the Concorde were responsible for the Air France jet's crash, to an extent that makes the six defendants guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nBoth official investigations found that a Continental Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 had taken off five minutes before Concorde with an improvised repair. A metal strip had been machined by mechanics instead of using a certified part. This strip dropped off the aircraft, leaving a 43cm (17in) piece of titanium on the runway.\nProsecutors and investigators concluded that as Concorde struck the part on takeoff a tyre burst and ripped apart, sending chunks of rubber flying. A large piece slammed into the underside of the wing hard enough to trigger a pressure wave that ruptured the fuel tank. Damaged wiring is believed to have been responsible for igniting this, creating a trailing fireball as the aircraft took off bound for New York. \nConcorde's pilots attempted to circle round for an emergency landing back at Charles de Gaulle Airport, but instead struck a hotel approximately three kilometres (two miles) from the airport. All 109 passengers and crew were on board, as well as four people in the hotel, were killed. The majority of victims were Germans heading to meet up with a cruise liner for a Caribbean holiday, the remainder of the 100 passengers were from Austria.\nJohn Taylor, the Continental mechanic who is alleged to have built and fitted the nonstandard part, and his boss Stanley Ford, have been targeted for prosecution. Both individuals and their employer deny responsibility. Also charged are two members of the UK-French firm behind Concorde - Arospatiale, who have since merged into Airbus parent EADS. Henri Perrier was head of testing for Concorde and the aircraft's chief engineer was Jacques Herubel; both have been charged for a perceived failure to locate and rectify design flaws with Concorde. The former chief of civil aviation, Claude Frantzen, is facing charges on the same basis.\nEach individual can be imprisoned for up to three years and fined up to 50,900 (US$71,000. Continental face a fine of up to 375,000 (US$520,000). The airline's defence claims the part on the runway had no role to play in the accident. TV channel Canal+ previously suggested the investigations and prosecution were a coverup of more serious issues with Concorde.\nThe broadcast alleged Concorde erupted into flames long before getting as far down the runway as the strip. Continental's lawyers say they can call 28 witnesses to give similar evidence and told the Le Parisien that they would seek a dismissal of the charges today. The case opened with judge Dominique Andreassier reading out every one of the 113 names of the deceased, followed by the charges against the six, in the court in Pontoise.\nThere are 80,000 pages of documents to be presented at trial, and 543 items are to be presented as evidence. The case is split into 90 volumes and is expected to take four months. The judge cautioned against losing touch with the human aspect of what is anticipated to be a very technical trial. The estimated cost is expected to be in excess of 3 million Euro (US$4.2 million).\nThe investigation found some contributory causes that can be linked to Air France. Four days before the crash an important tyre spacer was left off the Concorde by mechanics, and the plane was overloaded. The airport itself was also criticised for having cancelled a scheduled sweep of the runway. Air France lawyer Fernand Garnault, an aviation specialist, was adamant that Continental did play the main role in the accident; \"[i]t is clear that a piece from a Continental plane fell on the runway. It is clear that the origin of the accident was this. This is my personal conviction and of course that of Air France.\"\nFew families are represented at the trial, because all the passengers struck a deal with Air France to accept compensation in exchange for waiving their right to take legal action, leaving only those killed in the hotel and the crew. However, French group Fenvac are representing the families, and spokesman Stephane Gicquel said that the families would be observing keenly, that \"[t]his tragedy is part of their personal history and of their family history.\"\nCaptain Christian Marty's family's lawyer, Roland Rappaport, said outside court today that, \"[t]his accident should have been avoided. The weaknesses of the Concorde had been known for twenty years,\" while Air France's lawyers stated the inquiries had not located any evidence to suggest that Concorde had indeed encountered problems before reaching the metal debris.\nDaniel Soulez Larivire, who represents Frantzen, said, \"this accident was unforeseeable,\" and the original investigations should have agreed. Concorde suffered a string of similar incidents in the 1970s including one in Washington that came close to triggering a fire. \"They [the authorities] wanted to protect Concorde, the image of France that it projected. They should have stopped service then [1979],\" said Olivier Metzner, representing Continental. The plane was not grounded until after the accident, although it returned to service before being retired in 2003.\nMetzner told the court that former French air accident investigator Michel Bourgeois was to be a key witness. Bourgeois recently alleged that authorities were indeed hiding flaws with the airliner, saying \"[n]othing was allowed to disturb Air France [...] orders came from very high in the administration,\" and that investigations into Concorde's safety were shut down by the government."}

In Spain, the source of worry was reportedly because the government backed down from promised pension reform.\nEuropean Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet sought to ease investor fears, in part by noting that the deficit in the US is expected to hit 10% of GDP in 2010, compared with about 6% in the eurozone. He said that he was \"confident\" that Greece is moving in the right direction.\nTrichet did admit that it is of \"paramount importance\" for Greece, Portugal and Spain to get their public finances under control."}

{"id": 284, "ended": true, "text": "The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that the captain of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which crashed nearly a year ago outside Buffalo, New York during its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport, \"inappropriately responded to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the aeroplane did not recover,\" according to a statement issued by the NTSB.\nThe flight, operating as a codeshare with Continental Airlines under their Continental Connection brand, crashed last year on February 12, 2009 in Clarence Center, New York. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, crashed into a residence killing everyone on board as well as one on the ground.\nThe NTSB has blamed pilot error and poor training for the crash, noting that the plane's captain, Marvin Renslow, \"had not established a good foundation of attitude instrument flying skills early in his career, and his continued weaknesses in basic aircraft control and instrument flying were not identified and adequately addressed.\" Renslow's career spanned two decades and had failed five performance checks during that time. Colgan Air was only aware of three. Colgan said had they known about the other two, they would not have hired Renslow in 2005. \nColgan Air responded to the NTSB report in a letter: \"They [the pilots] knew what to do in the situation they faced that night a year ago, had repeatedly demonstrated they knew what to do, and yet did not do it. We cannot speculate on why they did not use their training in dealing with the situation they faced.\" \nThe Board added that Renslow's response to the \"stick shaker activation should have been automatic, but his improper flight control inputs were inconsistent with his training and were instead consistent with startle and confusion. The 24-year-old first officer, Rebecca Lynne Shaw, was noted for her young age and lack of experience.\nThe Board also concluded that \"the pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue.\" Renslow and Shaw had spent the night at the crew lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport in violation of Colgan Air's company policies. However, the board voted down making fatigue a contributing factor. Shaw, the first officer, had flown the previous night on two separate planes from the Pacific Northwest where she lived with her parents. Shaw also appeared to be suffering from a bad cold.\nHowever, the report also criticized Colgan saying that the airline, \"did not pro-actively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at a predominantly commuter base.\" Adding that, \"Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty.\"\nAnother factor brought up the by the NTSB was the violation of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) sterile cockpit rule. It was noted that first officer Shaw had sent two text messages before take-off at Newark. The second message was sent two minutes before take-off.\nPrior to landing, the cockpit voice recorder recorded that the pilots were holding a conservation that potentially distracted the captain from operating the plane. Robert Sumwalt, a member of the NTSB board said, \"It was continuous and one-sided, with the captain doing most of the talking.\" He added, \"It was as if the flight was just a means for the captain to conduct a conversation with this young first officer.\" \nThe chairwoman of the NTSB, Deborah Hersman, has noted that electronic devices are becoming a hazard to transportation. Hersman said, \"Recent NTSB investigations have identified personal wireless technology use on the job. This phenomenon is becoming more widespread, and these phone calls, texts and other distractions have deadly consequences and must be addressed with all due haste by the transportation industry.\"\nThe agency noted that distractions from electronics have played a part in many recent accidents and incidents, such as the August 2009 mid-air collision between a small private Piper aeroplane and a tour helicopter over the Hudson River in New York City killing all involved. The NTSB noted that one of the air traffic controllers was making a phone call and failed to warn the aircraft of the conflict that existed between each other in their airspace. However, this was disputed by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association which represents air traffic controllers nationwide. The NTSB later retracted some of its statements.\nThe other notable incident was that of Northwest Airlines Flight 188 in October, that overshot its destination of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport by 150 miles (241 km) before the pilots noticed. The pilots claimed they were checking schedules on their laptop computers in violation of basic piloting rules, the sterile cockpit rule and the policy of Delta Air Lines, who had recently acquired Northwest.\nThe NTSB's last board meeting which was held two weeks ago, about the 2008 train collision between a Metrolink commuter rail train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California also pertained to distractions by electronic devices. In the statement released by the NTSB for that meeting, the board stated that \"according to records from the wireless provider, on the day of the accident, while on duty, both the Metrolink engineer and the Union Pacific conductor used wireless devices to send and receive text messages.\" The NTSB has recommended that audio and video recorders be installed in locomotive and control cabs because of the collision."}

His crimes would involve going into houses of people who had entrusted house keys to him as he was employed by them as a handyman or a gardener. He then searched through drawers for underwear before carrying out sex acts and stealing or replacing the underwear, and then leaving the properties. He also stole some garments. The burglaries took place in the villages of Stalmine and Poulton-le-Fylde between the dates of January 1 and June 26 in 2009.\nOne person became suspicious and installed a hidden camera inside her bedroom. As a result, a 14 minute DVD was recorded which shows the former mayor walking naked from the waist downwards. The DVD was passed on to the police. Police officers later raided Stafford's residence and found the underwear, which had been marked with the names of the owners. The underwear is said to have been worth up to 900 (US$1407).\nThe trial was held in Preston Crown Court. There the Court heard of how the victims had been \"embarrassed, disgusted and shocked\" by the \"sexual kicks\" which the man had been getting. During a previous interview with police, Ian Stafford commented at how he felt \"deeply ashamed at the whole scenario because I have hurt people who have been excellent friends - I could not wish for better. I wish I had said something to someone earlier. I am not proud of any of this, I am sickened. I wish I could turn the clock back.\" \nInside the court on Thursday, Judge Heather Lloyd said to Stafford: \"Your private desires or fantasies which should only be your concern became public when you decided to do what you did in the homes of those who trusted you. To masturbate into a woman's underwear and place it back in the draw [sic], repeatedly, as seen in the DVD, as you have done in other homes is bluntly revolting and the impact on your victims is high.\" She sentenced Ian Stafford to two years in prison, with the recommendation that he takes therapy, a decision which was supported by Stafford's fourth victim.\nAfter the court trial had concluded, Detective Constable Steve Montgomery, who comes from Lancashire Police, stated: \"This has been a distressing ordeal for the victims involved, all of whom had let Mr Stafford into their homes, trusting him to carry out maintenance. They certainly did not expect him to search for, and steal, their possessions. There has been a breach of their trust in a very intimate nature.

{"id": 289, "ended": true, "text": "Commander Ali Dizaei of London's Metropolitan Police Service today became the most senior officer anywhere in the United Kingdom to be convicted of offences by a court. Dizaei, who was branded a \"criminal in uniform\" by Independent Police Complaints Commission chair Nick Hardwick, has been jailed for four years after he attempted to frame an Iraqi businessman.\nIt took a Southwark Crown Court jury under three hours to find Dizaei guilty of misconduct in a public office and attempting to pervert the course of justice. The charges carried a maximum of life imprisonment.\nDizaei, 47, who is head of the National Black Police Association, had gone to the Yas Persian restaurant, run by one of his friends, and taken his wife Shy with him. They then went to their car and struck up a conversation through its open window with the restaurant's manager. During this conversation they were approached by Waad al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi website designer in his twenties. He requested that Dizaei pay 600 that he owed Baghdadi, who had constructed his website.\nAccording to the Crown, this dispute had been ongoing for months and Dizaei had been attempting to intimidate Baghdadi. He told the Iraqi to depart when he entered the restaurant; although the businessman did, he stayed nearby and rang the 999 emergency number.\nThe exact content of the argument that led up to this is unclear. Dizaei and his wife testified that Baghdadi was abusive and threatening, telling the officer he would \"extract the money out of your throat\" while the owner of the Yas said he was \"a crook basically... His history ... everybody knows he's not a good gentleman,\" said owner Sohrab Eshragi. Eshragi said that the request Baghdadi leave the premises was due to concerns of trouble, claiming Baghdadi had been in a previous fight. Baghdadi denied the allegations and the court rejected Dizaei's version of events.\nWhile Baghdadi was making his emergency call, Dizaei arrested him and made a 999 call of his own. He requested assistence from other officers, and said that Baghdadi had assaulted him by stabbing his stomach with a shisha pipe. He maintained this account when police arrived and kept it up in written statements, but although Baghdadi was found to be carrying such a pipe examination of Dizaei's wounds by a police doctor concluded he had inflicted them upon himself. \nA Home Office pathologist questioned this finding for the defence. Dr. Nat Cary said it was based on a \"fundamentally flawed approach,\" and that the injuries were consistent with Dizaei's version of events. He has helped investigate the assassination of former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, and the death newspaper seller Ian Thomlinson, the latter of whom died during a G20 protest.\nThe Crown further alleged that Dizaei told Baghdadi \"I'll fuck your life... You think I don't know what you do in London... I'll find every single detail of your life in London.\" The prosecution case was presented by Peter Wright QC, who has prosecuted in trials over serial murders of Suffolk sex workers and a plot to bomb transatlantic airliners. He said that Dizaei's actions were a \"wholesale abuse of power by a senior police officer for entirely personal and oblique motives.\"\nJudge Justice Simon said that Dizaei had committed a \"grave breach of public trust\" and told him \"This sentence needs to send a clear message that police officers of whatever rank are not above the law.\" A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said outside the court that \"He abused his power and ignored his responsibility,\" and that while corruption was unacceptable in any police officer it was particularly so in a senior member of the forces. \"The public should have confidence that we will prosecute anyone, regardless of their position, if they commit serious offences. We believe justice has been served for the victim and the public.\" \n\"[I]f he [Dizaei] had been successful, Mr al-Baghdadi may have been sent to prison,\" noted Hardwick. \"Mr al-Baghdadi has shown tremendous strength of character throughout this case  from the moment he was confronted by Ali Dizaei, throughout our investigation, and finally when giving evidence at court. We are grateful for the confidence he placed in the IPCC and, as a result of that, justice has been done today.\"\nDizaei has been a policeman for 24 years, and at one stage was rumoured to be destined to take control of the Metropolitan Police, although the Metropolitan Police Authority may now choose to end this career. His trial, which began this month, is his second this decade. He was prosecuted in 2003 but cleared of any wrongdoing. The incident with Baghdadi was in June 2008 and Dizaei has been suspended on full pay since September of that year. Hardwick said that \"The greatest threat to the reputation of the police service is criminals in uniform like Dizaei.\""}

{"id": 297, "ended": true, "text": "The United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Board (AAIB) yesterday blamed a release of ice in the fuel system of a British Airways passenger jet as the cause of a crash two years ago at London's Heathrow Airport. Flight 38 from China was attempting to land when both engines lost almost all power  a condition called \"rollback\".\nThe exact phenomenon had never been previously identified, but it not only affected the British Airways jet two years ago but also a Delta Airlines jet above the United States later the same year. Both were Boeing 777 aircraft. That incident prompted the AAIB to collaborate with the US National Transportation Safety Board. \nBA 38 was approximately 43 seconds from touchdown when it experienced a dual engine rollback that was beyond the control of the flight crew. Captain Peter Burkill and co-pilot John Coward were later hailed as heroes for performing a successful crash landing 330 metres from the runway. The plane avoided nearby buildings and a road, leaving the landing gear deployed to act as shock absorbers. \nThe jet slid 372 metres after the crash, but all 136 passengers evacuated alive. 36 passengers and twelve crewmembers were injured, mostly suffering whiplash and one incurring a broken leg. The report concluded there was no time to alert the cabin crew or passengers to the situation developing in the cockpit.\nThe engine rollback was caused by ice forming in the fuel system; the ice came from water molecules existing as impurities in the fuel, and lined the fuel system. When extra fuel was pumped through to supply the engines for landing manoeuvres, the ice was dislodged. \nIt is believed to have then settled on a component called the fuel-oil heat exchanger, a dual-purpose component that runs oil pipes through the fuel system. The idea is to cool down hot oil and keep fuel warm to prevent freezing. As the result of previous safety recommendations from both the UK and US investigators Boeing and engine company Rolls-Royce have worked to redesign the part.\nEvery component of the aircraft complied with all relevant airworthiness standards, and the fuel also complied with the standards applying to it. Although ice problems have been known since the 1950s, sudden release problems were unheard of before the crash. The testing conducted as part of the investigation is thought to be unique and the aircraft experienced unusually low temperatures during the flight.\nA total of eighteen safety recommendations have been issued, of which nine came from an interim report and nine are new. Some of these apply to aircraft \"crashworthiness\"  the ability to withstand impact forces."}

He was then handed over to American authorities who covertly transported him to Morocco for interrogation on a suspicion that he received training on the handling of munitions from al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. His final destination, after two years in Morocco, was Guantnamo Bay; from 2004 until 2009 he was held in the US-run detention centre in Cuba. He was released last February without any charges being brought against him.\nToday's ruling, by the the Court of Appeal's three most senior judges, ordered previously redacted paragraphs detailing Binyam's treatment in US-managed captivity made public. The seven previously withheld paragraphs appear in a report on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website. They had purportedly been kept secret over fears publication would jeopardise intelligence sharing between the US and UK. A court ruling in August 2008 did ensure the redacted details were available to Binyam's legal team; however, this is their first release to a wider public.\nBinyam had, prior to May 2001, been subjected to a succession of interviews, \"as part of a new strategy designed by an expert interviewer.\" During this interrogation, Binyam Mohamed \"had been intentionally subjected to continuous sleep deprivation.  The effects of the sleep deprivation were carefully observed [...] combined with the sleep deprivation, threats and inducements were made to him.  His fears of being removed from United States custody and 'disappearing' were played upon [...] the stress brought about by these deliberate tactics was increased by him being shackled in his interviews\".\nThe effects of his treatment were apparently quite detrimental; \"[i]t was clear not only from the reports of the content of the interviews but also from the report that he was being kept under self-harm observation, that the interviews were having a marked effect upon him and causing him significant mental stress and suffering.\"\nIn February last year, Miliband denied that the United States threatened to reduce or cease terrorism-related intelligence sharing, but fought to keep the details released today secret; arguing publication would, \"cause real and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country.\"\nThe release of information known in 2001 implies that Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis misled the BBC's Today programme when, in August last year, he stated that, \"[w]e neither engage in, collude with or condone torture.\" The interview by Sarah Montague, with Lewis in Damascus, Syria, saw the minister challenged on the basis that the UK might \"turn a blind eye\" to torture. Lewis responded that, \"we always make it clear that torture is unacceptable and abhorrent\"; however, this was qualified, \"in a modern world you cannot counter terrorism by acting in isolation; we have to work on a global basis with many other countries.  And its true that some of those countries dont apply the same rules and the same standards as the United Kingdom\".\nLewis denied that the UK was \"complicit\" in torture, although his responses in the interview described information such as that released today as \"very serious allegations made against some of the intelligence services in some countries that we have to co-operate with in terms of protecting the security and the national interest of this country.\""}

Inside the jungle, having been reduced to rations of beans and rice, the two celebrities caught a rat before killing it and then cooking it, to give the beans and rice \"more protein\", before eating the rat, which contestant and actor George Hamilton described as \"actually quite nice\". Inside the programme's video diary room, at the time of the recording of it, Gino D'Acampo said: \"I saw one of these rats running around. I got a knife, I got its throat, I picked it up.\"\nRSPCA Australia had stated that performing an act like this on television was \"not acceptable\". Initially, Manning and D'Acampo were charged for animal cruelty. However, their charges were dropped when ITV made the confession that production staff had allowed the celebrities to carry out the act of killing the rat. After a court trial in Sydney, Australia, ITV got a fine of A$3000. The company also had to pay costs of A$2500 (US$2192 or 1396).\nAn ITV spokesperson said that \"ITV has apologised for the mistake which led to this incident.

{"id": 303, "ended": true, "text": "At the end of January, Bach Technology announced their new music file format, MusicDNA, which was developed as an intended replacement for the mp3 format, which has been the dominant format in music since its inception.  MusicDNA uses similar compression methods to mp3, but then also adds an xml file which defines other content that can be included.  Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas caught up with Bach Technology CEO Stefan Kohlmeyer to find out more.\n((Wikinews)) Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions.\n((WN)) Can you briefly explain what MusicDNA is?\n((Stefan Kohlmeyer)) We believe that MusicDNA is the successor to the MP3, the MusicDNA media extension enables music fans to access from one application the wide range of music-related content they want alongside the music itself - from lyrics, artwork and tour dates to blog posts, videos and twitter feeds.\nIn addition to all this extra content, MusicDNA files are also intelligent, and include extensive audio analysis information for each single track. This means that search and recommendation tools or automatic playlist generators will be much more sophisticated and provide much better results.\n((WN)) How long has it been in development and what role has Karlheinz Brandenburg, the man credited with inventing mp3, played in that?\n((SK)) In essence MusicDNA in its current context has been in development since the start of the company in 2007. Bach has an important strategic partnership with Fraunhofer IDMT with its CEO Karlheinz Brandenburg who is an important person for us in all research projects and visionary discussions about the development of the music market.\n((WN))  Is this just going to be another consumer hurting format war with iTunes LP?  What makes MusicDNA better than iTunes LP?\n((SK)) Unlike iTunes LP, MusicDNA files have been built on open standards and are completely platform agnostic, which means that, unlike iTunes LP, youre not tied to one device or media player.  So its about the opposite of format wars really.\nWhilst LP goes some way to adding value to digital music, it is still essentially a static file with some extra content bolted on. MusicDNA not only gives back all the things we lost when we switched to digital formats, lyrics, liner notes, artwork, but crucially it goes beyond that allowing fans to access everything from Twitter feeds and videos through to concert tickets, this will all dynamically update whenever you're online, so music fans always have the latest information to hand.\nImportantly with MusicDNA you can customise single tracks, youre not restricted to purchasing complete albums as you are with LP.\nAnd because all the additional rich media is integrated into the file (unlike iTunes LP), that content can be easily transferred from one device to another.\nMark Mulligan, vice president and research director of industry analysts Forrester Research recently put it well to the UKs Telegraph newspaper \"innovations like the iTunes LP need to go further.  People should pay just once to get everything that artist does over the next year in one file that is regularly updated.\"\n((WN)) Is this really what listeners want-more clutter to distract from the music itself?  What's wrong with mp3?\n((SK)) A lot of people, especially those who grew up buying music on vinyl and CD, miss the packaging, the liner notes, all the things that went hand in hand with albums, so for them that clutter is an important part of the experience.  \nWe developed MusicDNA based on how people interact with their favourite music and musicians today, so were just following the publics lead in many ways.  MusicDNA enables fans to stay constantly connected with the worlds of their favourite artists in a really convenient way. Importantly, MusicDNA files can be customised so that they contain as little or much extra content as the listener wants.\nYou have to remember the MP3 was developed over twenty years ago, think of how much has changed in that time. It has had a profound effect on the music industry, but beyond portability it doesn't actually add anything to the experience, the opposite in fact.\n((WN)) Will MusicDNA be any less susceptible to piracy than other formats?\n((SK)) As only paid for files will dynamically update MusicDNA should be an incentive for people to purchase legitimate files rather than downloading them from p2p networks.\nOver the last decade a lot of effort has gone into trying to stop piracy through sanctions and enforcement, and, well, the results speak for themselves. We believe in a carrot approach, giving the public what they actually want and a great incentive to go the legit route.\n((WN)) Many people argue that music is moving away from being owned and more towards models like Spotify; free, streamed music.  Is MusicDNA not too late to the party if this is so?\n((SK)) Like many in the industry Bach are of the view that there is no one silver bullet to suit all types of consumer, rather a variety of services will serve different fans with different needs.\nThere are many occasions when a download is preferable to a stream, and MusicDNA  files have the advantage of customised, at your fingertips, rich media available on- and offline.  And that is before considering the impact of streaming on growing bandwidth and energy requirements.\n((WN)) So when will we start to see MusicDNA and where?\n((SK)) Rollout will be staggered over 2010, with the first beta versions available around Easter and the full commercial rollout expected over summer.\n((WN)) And finally, your favourite artist at the moment to be released on MusicDNA this year?\n((SK)) It's too early to say, but we're in talks with some very exciting artists. I would love to see all my old heroes on MusicDNA, starting with Led Zeppelin and The Clash.\n((WN)) Thank you again for your time.  Good luck with the launch."}

Shortly after Azhar's arrest in May last year police came to take away Bibit Rianto and Chandra Hamzah, two deputy commissioners, to face trial for corruption.

{"id": 313, "ended": true, "text": "The United States Missile Defense Agency have announced that their airborne laser system has successfully shot down a ballistic missile for the first time. In a test on Thursday the \"Airborne Laser Testbed\" (ALTB), a modified Boeing 747-400F, detected a boosting short-range missile and tracked it using a low-energy laser. A second low-energy laser was used to measure and compensate for atmospheric disturbance, before the aircraft's High Energy Laser was used to destroy the target.\nThe missile was liquid-fuelled and said to be \"threat-representative\", possibly similar to a Scud. It was launched from sea, and shot down by the ALTB within two minutes. In a second test less than an hour later, a solid-fuel missile launched from a ground location was also successfully hit by the High Energy Laser, but deliberately not destroyed. A similar missile was destroyed on February 3.\nIn a press release announcing the successful tests the Missile Defense Agency said: \"The revolutionary use of directed energy is very attractive for missile defense, with the potential to attack multiple targets at the speed of light, at a range of hundreds of kilometers, and at a low cost per intercept attempt compared to current technologies.\"\nThe ALTB is described as a \"pathfinder\" for the use of directed energy in missile defense. It is designed to operate at high altitudes above the clouds, and to detect and destroy ballistic missiles soon after launch whilst they are still in their boosting phase. The aircraft is provided by Boeing, the main laser by Northrop Grumman, and the control systems by Lockheed Martin.\n\"Through its hard work and technical ingenuity, the government-industry team has produced a breakthrough with incredible potential,\" stated Greg Hyslop, vice president of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. He said that the experiment had \"made history\". \nThe US has been working on the program since 1996, and has faced numerous problems in that time. The megawatt-class High Energy Laser is known as the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL), and consists of six modules, each as large as an SUV. The sheer weight of chemicals needed was almost too much for the 747 jet. The laser also had problems with accuracy due to atmospheric conditions.\nFebruary's tests were originally scheduled to be carried out in 2002. The amount spent getting the project to this stage has also risen from a planned US$1 billion to $7.3 billion. Last year, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates cut the program back to a single jet for research, suggesting it would not see actual deployment.\nThe reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times more powerful than the chemical laser in the plane right now to be able to get any distance from the launch site to fire, Gates told Congress. \"So, right now the [jet] would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase.\"\nGates also raised concerns at the large number of planes that would be required, and the ensuing cost. However, he said that directed energy weapons still had potential for missile defense."}

The attacking forces consist of Afghan, American, British, and Canadian troops.\nOperation Moshtarak marks the largest Afghan-ISAF joint offensive to-date. The aim of the operation is to wrest control of the town in Helmand Province from Taliban forces.\nThe operation was announced several days in advance in order to allow the 80,000 civilians in the town an opportunity to leave, or prepare for the siege. Reports indicate over 10,000 citizens subsequently left and the local government is preparing shelter for them in nearby towns. This strategy is hoped to minimise civilian casualties; however, the side-effect is giving Taliban defenders time to prepare.\n15,000 troops are involved in the operation, while the Taliban defense is believed to consist of between 1,000 and 2,000 militants. The attack was launched with an initial wave of over 4,000 US Marines, 1,500 from the Afghan Army plus 300 US Army soldiers flying into the city by helicopter at about 2am local time (2130 UTC).\nOperation Moshtarak is the first major operation in Afghanistan since the United States sent 30,000 reinforcements in late December. If successful, ISAF hopes it may mark a turning point in the conflict in Helmand, as Marja provides a base of operations for key Taliban figures in the province.

{"id": 316, "ended": true, "text": "Four years ago, on February 9, a major Polish newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza published a report detailing a hoax in Polish Wikipedia entitled Henryk Batuta. The author of the report was Konrad Godlewski; several weeks later, Godlewski began editing Polish Wikipedia. The results of his work include one featured article  pismo chiskie (Polish for \"Chinese character\")  as well as various articles relating to China.\nDuring our interview, Godlewski discusses memes, hoaxes, and the Batuta Army  the creators of the hoax his paper reported on. From February this year, a special project on the Polish Wikipedia, BATUTA, saw a makeshift taskforce work on improving the quality of content. BATUTA stands for \"Bezwzgldna Akcja Troskliwego Urdawiania Tysicy artykw\", roughly translated as \"Ruthless Action of Carefully Adding References to Thousands of Articles\".\n((Wikinews))  You are the author of the first news story about the Henryk Batuta hoax, uncovered four years ago in the Polish Wikipedia. Do you remember when did the authors of the hoax first come to you? Was it just before the publication or earlier? The hoax was uncovered on January 20 and the story was published on February 9, so there was a period of time between those two dates... \n((Konrad Godlewski)) I found them myself. Accidentally. I was looking for new, interesting stories about the Internet. My newspaper colleague Robert Sankowski told me he had heard somewhere about a friend of a friend who had been doing some huge scam in Wikipedia. Step by step, I had traced that person. This was a few months before the publication, back in late 2005. A representative from Batuta's Army asked me to hold on with publication, even though the article had already been visible in Wikipedia for many months.\n((WN)) Did you follow the process of deletion of the article?\n((KG)) Yes, for the last few days. The Army from the very beginning wanted to test Wikipedia's defense mechanisms. It was then when I had a meeting with them and they told me about their views. They knew their hoax was nearing its end and they wanted to close it somehow. \n((WN)) In your story you wrote they wanted to show how thoughtless the people of Warsaw were when it came to names of streets and neighborhoods. Now it turns out it was more about Wikipedia and its mechanisms. \n((KG)) It was about a number of things at the same time. It was easy to notice the hoax was created by really smart people. Testing Wikipedia was one of the aspects of this entire thing.\nThe second one was the attitude towards streets and generally Poland's communist past. As one could easily guess, Batuta's Army had rather right-wing political views, most probably close to IPN [e.d. note: Instytut Pamici Narodowej/IPN, English: National Memory Institute is a governmental agency in Poland conducting both criminal investigations and scientific research into the country's communist past], which fights against communist streets' namesakes.    \nAnd there was a third reason. As I'm sure you remember, in the 90s, conspiracy theories concerning Jews were popular in Poland. As some of the people of such origin had changed their names, the conspiracy theory made people see Jews nearly everywhere. Such lists were printed on paper and later they got published on the Internet.\n((WN)) It's a bit strange. Having right-wing views, the Army caused the right-wing websites, which copied the hoax from Wikipedia, to get discredited as an effect of this.\n((KG)) Not all right-wing people are uneducated individuals with antisemitic views. \n((WN)) The same IP number (which is dynamic but from a narrow range) which was used to create the hoax, is still being used today to edit Wikipedia. For example, quite recently someone tried to smuggle in a biography of \"Hipolit Pieciuk  sculptor and social activist\". Google shows no information on this biography. They've added just text, not an article. Does it mean they have not give up on Wikipedia? Your article in \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" ended with the words \"Batuta's Army is asking for anonymity and claims that Henryk Batuta is not their last word\".\n((KG)) I haven't heard about Hipolit. As far as I know, Batuta's case actually turned up to be their last word. As far as I know those people have made careers and they now have more serious things to care about. \n((WN)) So they don't want to reveal themselves?\n((KG)) I imagine it wouldn't look good in their CVs. There are people who think of such scam as a point of honor. I don't think that's the case with Batuta's Army. Anyway, this case had also had an effect on me. Before the Batuta story I had made a few trial editions in Wikipedia. But later something turned me on. I thought there was a group of idealistic people who want to make humanity happier with their meticulous work. And someone tried to make idiots of them. \n((WN)) So you've started to develop articles up to featured article standards.\n((KG)) Don't exaggerate. I've written just one such article. But thanks to this, I've realized how important Wikipedia had become. I don't think there is single journalist who doesn't use it. ((WN)) Would you reveal your Wikipedia nickname? \n((KG)) Yes, it's actually my high school nickname  conew. Sadly, after some time I stopped. My family got bigger and I didn't have enough time to make all of humanity happier.\n((WN)) When we were talking soon after your publication, you wrote to me you had hoped there would be some positive effects of your story. Do you think you've initiated a landslide change?\n((KG)) I don't think it was a landslide. But still, I do acknowledge the fact that Batuta's case has become something of a milestone in the development of Wikipedia. I had a chance to about it with Jimmy Wales. It was in the time when the German Wikipedia was testing new, stricter editorial guidelines.\nHowever, I think the most important was the impact on the other side  the readers. Even the best editorial system lets some mistakes pass undetected. I know it, I've worked in several newspapers. Batuta's case reminds us the old truth: dubito ergo sum. There are mistakes in respected encyclopedias and books as well. Sometimes those are \"Dawkins-like\" mistakes, if you remember the chapter about memes in \"The Selfish Gene\".\nMy favorite example is the one about Micha Boym, Polish Jesuit and one of the first sinologists. He had done a great job with his descriptions of Chinese plants and animals. His works were later published in Europe. Sometimes his text were stolen from him and published under other people's names. There was a case of \"green-furred turtle\". Boym wrote about it because it was extremely bizarre: a turtle with green fur. In fact it was a kind of seaweed growing on the turtle's shell. Boym described it in his Latin text as \"viridium\". And printers from Vienna made it \"vindium\" which can be translated as \"floating in air\". This slight typing mistake made people in the West believe there were flying turtles in China. What's more, there were pictures showing this unusual thing.  \n((WN)) Batuta also started to mutate and it happened at the very beginning. \n((KG)) That's because Wikipedia's articles are the best example of memetics at work. The articles are like some living organisms transferred to a new environment  with time they evolve, adapting to the requirements such as neutral of point of view, proper language, verifiability and, most importantly, factual truth.   \n((WN)) In the printed edition of \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" your text was accompanied by a photo, supposedly showing Henryk Batuta. It actually did not appear in the Wikipedia article, but even Jimbo mentioned that photo when he was explaining this situation to the journalists.\n((KG)) Oh yes. The photo was the idea of the editor of that day's edition. It's a petty it is now stuck somewhere in Gazeta'sarchives because it a really great job by the photo editor. Maybe Wikipedia should ask \"Gazeta\" for permission to use this little masterpiece. \n((WN)) When I read some recent texts about Batuta I often come across different mutations of the story. The most common is the one which says the journalists were the ones who uncovered the hoax, in spite of the fact that your text was published several days after the uncovering made by the Wikimedians themselves. \n((KG)) That's correct. It is quite common to attribute different things to the journalists because of their job which is to go around, look and investigate. I've seen Batuta being quoted in many publications on Wikipedia and the Internet. This is part of a broader problem of credibility of sources. It's horrifying but we are surrounded by the half-truths and lies. \n((WN)) Roman, Wadysaw, Marek  the names of the members of Batuta's Army were obviously false as well? \n((KG)) Yes, they were \"alternative\".\n((WN)) Was the term \"Batuta's Army\" created after you had already begun to talk? Or maybe they came to you already with this term? \n((KG)) Batuta's Army was invented by the hoax' creators as we spoke. Probably they wanted it to sound like some well-know political terrorist organizations like IRA or Red Army Faction. It was a kind of joke.\n((WN)) News about Batuta became a \"good meme\" and later it began to live a life of its own. Many legends originated from this story. Do you think it will become a \"hard\" urban legend?\n((KG)) I had thought so, but fortunately the Wikimedians woke up right in time and put an end to this. Today the original Batuta article is like an antibody in a vaccine  accompanied by a secure commentary, it can be used by anyone for the sake of his/her own immunity against such a \"virus\". However, another \"Jewish conspiracy\" theory is still thriving. It has something to do with Batuta's article, as in the hoax he was a communist activist with you-know-what origin. The theory I'm talking about was made popular by Okhrana (Russian secret police from the tzars times) with the publication of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". It has made its way as far as to Japan. Recently I've been following its spread in China. A book called \"The Currency Wars\" has recently been published there. The author used to work at American financial institutions. When he came back to China, he wrote the book describing how America's finances are under control by a group of friends with common ancestry. \nI don't think there's any way of defense against a good hoax. I'm sure at least a few such Batutas are hiding somewhere in Wikipedia. It's a classical evolutionary arms race. \n((WN)) When media published a story about a hoax concerning a false product (medicine for hangover), they praised the company for visionary marketing, despite the fact it came down to a deception. Why in the conflict between citizens and business, the media represents the corporations?\n((KG)) Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. I don't think you can simplify it to such an extent. This is a chain: journalist  editor  publisher  owner. Each of the elements has its own motivations and there is little in common between them. That's maybe with the exception  of desire for profit. But there are also some journalists who work mainly for their ideals.\nI don't remember in detail that particular case, but a tendency to deceive is part of the human nature. What's more, people enjoy being deceived, they appreciate manipulation as long as it's witty and funny. One of the authors compared Batuta's case to provocations which are the basis of the modern conceptual art. The artist gets into the public space and shocks people in order to make them react, to make the viewer part of the game.  \n((WN)) Maybe it's my oversimplification indeed. And maybe that's because Wikipedia itself is being perceived as if it was a corporation. I remember when Google's Knol was launched and one of the media stories called Knol David and Wikipedia Goliath. \n((KG)) It's a question of marketing and public relations. Google, as any modern company, spends a lot of money to create and maintain the image of both itself and its products. And Wikipedia is a bunch of Internet users who tries to set its own order by democratic means. It's part of democracies' nature that they need years to earn their own ethos, image and culture of organization. Just compare Polish and British democracy.   \n((WN)) OK, so I classically thank you for talking to me. \n((KG)) Thank you."}

The group were able to carry out purchases using a card, even without knowing the associated personal identification number (PIN), by using a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack.\nRetail terminals at the point of sale require the cardholder to insert their card and enter their secret PIN before a transaction can be authorised. They then communicate with the microchip built in to the card itself, which holds the PIN. If the correct number has been given, this chip returns a standard verification code (0x9000) to the terminal.\nIn the researchers' attack they inserted a genuine card into a second reader, connected to a laptop. The laptop is linked by thin wires to a fake card, which is inserted into the retailer's terminal. The laptop relays the communications between the terminal and the stolen, but genuine, card, up until the stage where the PIN is to be checked. At this point it intercepts and responds with the verification code, no matter what number was entered. The retailer's terminal then believes that the correct PIN has been entered, and the card can be told that a signature was used to verify the cardholder instead.\nTheir technique has been tested successfully on cards from six different issuers: Bank of Scotland, Barclaycard, Co-operative Bank, Halifax, HSBC and John Lewis.\nThe group say that not much technical skill is required for the attack, and suggested the equipment needed could be kept in a backpack, with the wires to the fake card running down a user's sleeve. They believe the equipment could be miniaturised to the size of a remote control.\n\"In practice how this attack would work is that one reasonably technically skilled person would build a device that carries out the attack and then sell this equipment on the internet just like criminals already do,\" said Dr Steven Murdoch who worked on the project.\nProfessor Anderson claimed that the attack could already be in use by criminals. \"We have many examples of people who have had their cards stolen and then purchases made using the chip and pin,\" he said. \"They are adamant they didn't use it but if the banks say chip and pin has been used you have to pay. I think many of these people would have been victim of the kind of technique we have developed.\"\nHe was scathing about bank claims that the system was secure. \"The banks are wrong. All the banks are lying. They are maliciously and wilfully deceiving the customer. If there was any justice then the police would be looking into this. The system is not fit for purpose.\"\nConsumer group Which? have also called for an investigation, stating that in a recent survey one in seven people said that money had been taken from their accounts without authorisation. Around half of these did not have the money refunded by the bank.\n\"We want the banks to look into these potential flaws,\" said Cathy Neal from Which? Money, \"because we have had many examples where the banks have said a pin was used and the customer said it hasn't.\"\nOver 90 percent of UK card transactions at point-of-sale use chip and PIN, according to the UK Payments Administration. The attack does not affect ATM transactions, which use different standards. Mark Bowerman, a spokesman for the group which represents card companies, said that there was no evidence the attack was in use and emphasised that card fraud had fallen with the introduction of chip and PIN.\n\"We are taking this paper very seriously, as maintaining excellent levels of card security is paramount,\" he said. \"However, we strongly refute the allegation that chip and PIN is broken.\"\nThe research paper has been made available as a working draft, and is due to be published at the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium in May 2010. Members of the banking industry were informed of the vulnerability in early December last year."}

They all rely on sales taxes and fares to fund their services, but the recent recession has reduced sales tax revenues, and unemployment has caused ridership to fall. Compared to 86.8 million trips in 2008, Metra reported that only 82.3 million trips were provided in 2009. As spokeswoman Judy Pardonnet said, \"We're looking at any opportunity to increase non-fare revenue.\"\nA law approved by former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich in 2008 granted free rides to all seniors regardless of income, adding to the decreasing fare revenues as well.

In addition, advertising space could be sold on the outside of train cars as well. As for the naming rights to stations and routes, Metra plans to hire a consultant that would figure out the details of such a proposal. Spokesperson Meg Reihle did not know how much money Metra could gain from the sale or which organizations would be interested in buying.\nAccording to Ms. Reihle, public transit agencies in other cities have sold naming rights as well, such as the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in Cleveland and Long Island Rail Road in Long Island. TECO Energy sponsors a rail line in Tampa's Hillsborough Area Regional Transit for US$1 million over ten years.\nThroughout its 26-year history, Metra has named several of its locomotives and renamed two stations: Ogilvie Transportation Center, which was previously named North Western Station, and Millennium Terminal, which was previously called Randolph Street. No transactions were made in renaming those two stations, however. There is also a  Station named after the candy maker Mars, but that station was named before Metra took it over, and the company doesn't pay Metra for any naming rights.\nExecuive Director Phil Pagano sees the proposal as a way for businesses to advertise themselves. \"I think the business community recognizes that transit is positive for their advertising benefit,\" said Mr. Pagano at a board meeting. In addition to businesses, hospitals located near the train stations could purchase naming rights as well. However, Mr. Pagano has also stated that \"the agency would be selective about the type of businesses it partners with.\"\nMetra has said that it will be sensitive to the wishes of the communities near the stops, and town names will not be removed from station names. Rather, both the municipality and the sponsoring organization would share the naming rights, such as in renaming Naperville Station to \"Naperville Boeing Station\". \"I'm not sure whether [the old name] is first or second, but definitely it's going to have to be there,\" said Mr. Pagano."}

For the UK, this is the second largest month-on-month inflation rate increase on record. The inflation rate for the country has also now reached its highest level since November 2008.\nThe causes of this inflation rise include a 70% rise in oil prices, and value added tax recently being increased to 17.5%. The headline inflation rate of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) also increased from 2.4% for the month of December 2009 to 3.7% for the month of January 2010. Meanwhile, the underlying rate of RPI increased from 3.8% to 4.6% over the same period.\nThe British Government has an inflation target of 2%, which was surpassed by more than 1%. For this reason, Mervyn King, who is the Governor of the Bank of England has written a required explanatory letter to Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling. In the letter, King wrote: \"Although it is likely to remain high over the next few months, inflation is more likely than not to fall back to the target in the second half of this year.\"\nAlistair Darling then wrote a letter in response, which said that the future expectations of the inflation was \"subject to some uncertainty\" as countries around the world continue to recover from what he called the \"deepest downturn in modern times\"."}

Per this accord, federal attorneys recommended a sentence of no longer than 33 months in prison, opposed to the 48 months that US District Judge Stephen Robinson (who was not bound to this agreement) chose to hand down instead. \n\"I think it's fair to say that with great power comes great responsibility and great consequences,\" Judge Robinson said upon sentencing. \"I think the damage caused by Mr. Kerik is in some ways immeasurable.\"\n\"Today's sentencing of Bernard Kerik is one of the most powerful recent reminders that no one in this country is above the law,\" added US Attorney Preet Bharara.\nKerik, who was accompanied by his wife and three children, briefly addressed the court: \"I make no excuses.

His distinguished actions following the 2001 September 11th Attacks transformed him into a respected national figure.  This earned him the praise of then-president George W. Bush, who in turn nominated him for the lead Homeland Security post.  It was during the vetting process that Kerik's suspected ties to organized crime came out.  This marked the beginning of his long fall from grace. \nOutside the courthouse, Kerik gave a statement to the media and general public before being driven home: \"I'd like to apologize to the American people for the mistakes I have made and for which I have just accepted responsibility.

The result of the vote was 53 to 8 in favor of expulsion.\nFederal judge William H. Pauley III denied a request to temporarily block the expulsion. A lawsuit had been filed by Monserrate, which had asked for a reversal of the former Senator's explusion and in addition sought a block on a March 16 special election for a replacement.\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union supported Monserrate in the case. The former Senator argued that the act of being expelled from the Senate was not appropriate, as he claimed it violated due process.\nJudge Pauley ruled, \"the question of who should represent the 13th Senatorial District is one for the voters, not for this court.\" The judge explained that the voting rights of the citizens of the district formerly represented by Monserrate would not be significantly negatively impacted, due to the proximity of the upcoming special election.

According to the union, the strike was over reduced flying time for the pilots, triggered by Lufthansa's recent acquisition of several smaller airlines, which the union says is causing traffic to be diverted from union-operated routes.

In a statement issued by Lufthansa, however, the airline said that the union also demanded a greater say in the operation of the airline, which Lufthansa was unwilling to agree to.\nOn Monday, less than 24 hours after it began, the union suspended the strike, agreeing to resume negotiations.  A spokesman for the union said Lufthansa and the union had reached an agreement after a hearing at a Frankfurt court, where Lufthansa had filed an injunction against the union, calling the strike \"disproportionate.\"  The strike is to be officially lifted at midnight Monday, although it's unclear when operations will return to normal.

According to the authors of the letter, Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak, Toyota dismissed, rather than investigated, the idea that the cars' computers were at fault.

Toyota also released a study commissioned from the research firm Exponent that said electronic systems were not to blame.  \nAccording to the House committee, however, the study involved only six vehicles, none of which had problems with their electrical systems, and was insufficient to produce an accurate result. \"Our  preliminary assessment is that Toyota  resisted the possibility that electronic defects could cause safety   concerns, relied on a flawed engineering report and made misleading   public statements concerning the adequacy of recent recalls to address   the risk of sudden unintended acceleration.\"\nThe company is under a criminal investigation, and has received two subpoenas for documents from two House committees relating to the recalls, although whether they are directly related to the letter is unclear.

A confidential internal presentation in July 2009 made the claim, and a month later, a Lexus ES, one of the models under the limited recall crashed in California, killing four people.  The claims apparently referenced a September, 2007 recall of floor mats that could trap gas pedals, the same problem that triggered a full recall of numerous Toyota cars to fix the same problem.

According to the report on January 21 2010, the army had plotted to provoke Greek fighter jets into shooting down a Turkish military jet and plant bombs in Istanbul mosques. The Turkish military had said documents were part of a military training seminar and not meant to be carried out.\nChief of General Staff lker Babu on January 25 called these allegations unconscionable and said they were part of a campaign of psychological warfare designed to undermine public trust in the armed forces.\nThis is not something weve ever experienced in Turkey before, so its very hard to predict what will happen, said Etyen Mahcupyan, director of the democratization program at Istanbul research institute Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation. Possible military responses may range from a mass resignation to a statement expressing faith in the judicial process, he said.\n29 of those detained are being questioned by Istanbul police and another ten officers were brought before an Istanbul court on Tuesday morning according to reports by  NTV and state-run Anatolian news agency.\nThe Turkish Armed Forces have been responsible for 4 military coups in Turkey in the last 50 years.  Other senior military officers have been arrested and indicted in separate plot to overthrow the government, involving a supposed far-right, ultra-nationalist group known as Ergenekon.

The axis about which the Earths mass is balanced should have moved by 2.7 milliarcseconds (equal to approximately eight centimeters or three inches).\"\nGross compared the Chile earthquake with the 9.1 magnitude Sumatra earthquake in 2004 which generated a tsunami. According to him, that temblor shortened the day by 6.8 microseconds and moved the axis by about 2.3 milliarcseconds.\nThe scientist noted that the Chilean earthquake moved the Earth's axis more than the Sumatran one, despite not being as strong for two reasons. The first, he said, is because it was located in the mid-latitudes of the globe, which made it more effective in altering the axis. The other reason was that the Chilean earthquake fault was steeper than that in Sumatra, which results in more vertical motion and thus more change in the figure axis.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Radio, David Kerridge, the head of Earth hazards and systems at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, described how the earthquake may have caused such a change in the axis. \"Its what we call the ice-skater effect,\" Kerridge  explained.  He then described how when an ice skater executes a spin, if the skater pulls in his or her arms, the skater's rate of spin will increase. \"Its the same idea with the Earth going around.  If you change the distribution of mass, the rotation rate changes.\""}

According to an unnamed official, the review \"will point to dramatic reductions in the stockpile, while maintaining a strong and reliable deterrent.\" \nAs part of the new policy, conventional weapons will have a greater role in the future. According to officials, there are thousands of weapons that could be retired, largely by eliminating those currently stored. The move comes as a significant step towards Obama's stated goal of reducing and eventually ending the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide.\nThe policy changes come as part of the Nuclear Posture Review, a document which is undertaken by all presidents. In addition to the reduction of nuclear weapons, Obama's review  will also adjust the United States' defense towards non-nuclear options, including missile defense, largely within striking distance of the Persian Gulf to reduce the threat posed by countries such as Iran.  \nA centerpiece of the new policy is a new plan called the \"Prompt Global Strike,\" which involves a new type of conventional weapon that could be fired from the U.S. and reach anywhere in the world within an hour, providing an effective option for attacks worldwide, such as against a missile launch from North Korea or a strike against Al-Qaeda in Pakistan. The new weapons would achieve the same effects as nuclear weapons, without the threat of conventional war escalating into nuclear war.\nThe changes reflect a new focus on nonproliferation and arms control by the Obama administration, policies that were largely dismissed by the Bush administration. In conjunction with new domestic policies, the Obama administration is trying to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear explosions for any purposes. \nThe treaty was defeated in the 1990s, during the Clinton presidency, and still faces strong resistance in the U.S. Senate. The Obama administration is also trying to revise the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close loopholes that have been exploited by North Korea and Iran.\nThe administration has also been pressured to redefine the role of America's nuclear arsenal. Democrats have been pressuring the administration to formally declare that the role of America's nuclear weapons is solely to deter nuclear attack on the United States. \nAmerican military officials, as well as some officials within the White House, however, have urged the administration to retain more ambiguous wording from the Bush era, which says that nuclear deterrence is only the primary role of American nuclear weapons, which would leave open the option of using nuclear weapons against enemies that threaten the US with chemical or biological weapons."}

One rebel said that at least US$ 95 million (63 million) from  Western governments and private charities  was diverted into rebel coffers. \nThis was also noted in a declassified Central Intelligence Agency assessment of the famine situation titled Ethiopia: Political and Security Impact of the Drought, in which the report states, \"Some funds that insurgent organizations are raising for relief operations, as a result of increased world publicity, are almost certainly being diverted for military purposes.\" \nDuring the 19841985 famine, Ethiopia was fighting Eritrean and Tigray rebels in those two northern provinces, although Eritrea has since gained its independence. Since the countryside was out of the government's control, aid was brought in from neighboring Sudan. Some aid came in the form of food, while other aid came as cash which would be used by the aid agencies to buy grain from Ethiopian farmers.\nRebels would disguise themselves as traders and merchants to get their hands on the currency. \"I was given clothes to make me look like a Muslim merchant. This was a trick for the NGOs,\" said Gebremedhin Araya, a senior member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\nOne such aid worker that brought the grain was Max Peberdy, who worked for the charity Christian Aid. Peberdy is seen in a photo with Araya buying grain. \nAraya said that only some of the sacks were filled with grain; the rest were filled with sand.  The transaction was overseen by a member of the Relief Society of Tigray (REST), the humanitarian wing of the TPLF.  The money was then given to TPLF leaders, including chairman Meles Zenawi, who has been Prime Minister of Ethiopia since 1991.  Zenawi has not commented on the allegations.\nPeberdy disputes the claims that he was duped, saying, \"As far as we were concerned and as far as we were told by REST, the people we were dealing with were merchants.\"  He added, \"It's 25 years since this happened, and in the 25 years it's the first time anybody has claimed such a thing.\"\nHowever, an exiled TPLF commander who lives in the Netherlands, Aregawi Berhe, is backing Araya's story.  He said the group got their hands on over US$100 million (66 million) of which 95% went to buy weapons and build up a hardliner Marxist party inside the rebel movement.  The remaining five percent would go to famine victims.  Berhe told the BBC that the group would put on a \"drama\" to get the money.  Berhe said, \"The aid workers were fooled.\"\nIn response to the allegations, the charity Christian Aid issued a statement saying, \"There are allegations in the story which are against all of Christian Aid's principles and our initial investigations do not correspond to the BBC's version of events.\"\nNick Guttmann, who is director of emergency relief operations for the group, says the \"story has to be put into context\".  \"We were working in a major conflict, there was a massive famine and people on all sides were suffering,\" Guttmann said, adding, \"Both the rebels and the government were using innocent civilians to further their own political ends.\" \nBob Geldof, the Irish rock star who help organized Live Aid, said, \"We are talking about a disgruntled, exiled general.  The essence of the report also is not just about Live Aid.  It's that all monies going into Tigray  that would be Oxfam, Save the Children, UNICEF and Christian Aid  somehow, we were all duped and gulled.  And that's simply not the case.

Regardless of the increase, China still spends significantly less on its military as a proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) than other countries around the world.  China spends about 1.4% of its GDP on the military, while the United States spends about 4% of its GDP on the military.  The US, which accounts for 48% of the world's military spending, has frequently encouraged China to be more transparent about its military spending, a challenge which China said it was meeting.\nAt a press conference, Mr. Li said that the increase was in response to various security threats to China, although the nature of the threats were not specified.  He did, however, say that, \"The only purpose of China's limited military strength is to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"  He also said that the government has limited military spending to the best of its ability, and had tried to ensure a balance between the military and other needs.\nAccording to US military analysis and official Chinese reports, China has been steadily increasing military spending since the late 1980s, when the country began a program of improving its entire armed forces, including developing and producing weapons and equipment. The US Pentagon issued a report in 2009, saying that military spending had increased by an average of 12.9% annually since 1996. Based on this, analysts say that the earlier large spending increases could explain the slower increase for 2010. China in the past few years has seen dramatic spending increases in other sectors, especially costs related to the global financial crisis, and these sectors have complained about the amount of military spending.

At the time of the invasion, Brown was the Chancellor of spending for the British Armed Forces.\nBrown comments were mainly directed at critics who had alleged that he had limited the spending budget for the war.  Brown said that he had told then Prime Minister Tony Blair that he \"would not try to rule out any military option on the grounds of cost.\"  One of the most notable criticisms involved the use of the Snatch Land Rovers, a patrol vehicle used following the invasion. People had complained that the vehicles were vulnerable to road side bombs.  Brown, however, alleged that he fulfilled all requests for better vehicles.  Regarding the Land Rovers, Brown said that he moved to replace them as soon as he heard complaints.\nIn addition to defending his budget decisions, Brown also defended the overall decision to go into Iraq. Brown said that invading was \"the right decision\" and that it was based on \"the right reasons.\" He said the international community was justified in its invasion. However, Brown admitted he may have been unknowledgeable about certain aspects of the war, and hinted that the possibility that things could have been done better. Brown mentioned that there were \"learnt lessons\" from the war. One specific regret he made was that did not apply more pressure towards America regarding their plans for Iraq following the invasion. During the testimony, Brown emphasized the importance of post-invasion planning and reconstruction. Brown also mentioned that he was unaware of doubts that another Cabinet member had about the validity of the evidence that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction. The member, Robin Cook, later resigned because of his opposition to the war. This is relevant because both the UK and America had claimed that Hussein had had the weapons, and used this as part of their cases for the invasion. It was later revealed that Hussein had never had the weapons.  \nIn addition to the issues regarding his handling of the war, Brown is also in the situation of being up for reelection.

The Chicxulub crater was also discovered in Mexico at approximately that same time, therefore the theory gained scientific acceptance.  More recent explanations of the cause of dinosaur's extinction included that perhaps volcanic eruptions on Deccan traps or multiple asteroid crashes ended the dinosaurs' existence.\nThe team performed chemical analyses of soil and fossil samples, where a high concentration of iridium (which is commonly found in asteroids and meteors) was found, which dated back to the approximate time of the asteroid crash. \nThe asteroid measured approximately 7.5 miles wide, and hit with an impact of one billion times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.

Polling opened at 7 AM (local time) and immediately bombs were detonated and mortar rounds landed throughout the city.\nIn Shurta, West Baghdad, twelve were confirmed dead, and rescue workers saved twenty from the debris of a demolished building.

No polling stations were hit.\nNouri Maliki, the present Prime Minister, called for a strong turnout to boost democracy in the country. Although violence in Iraq is much reduced from its peak, hundreds of people are dying each month even now and the country continues to have poor infrastructure. \nTo prevent attacks, the border with Iran was shut down, several troops deployed, and movement of unauthorized vehicles banned, leaving Baghdad's roads almost empty. Despite this, people continued to head to the polls. \"If we had to crawl, we would crawl in order to vote,\" said a resident, Ali Abdul Wahab, though according to him: \"anyone we vote for will be bad.\"\nOn Saturday, a car bomb detonated near a parking lot used by pilgrims in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, killed three. Two Iranians and an Iraqi were those who died in the attack, only about 300 yards from the Imam Ali shrine, a holy site in Shiite Islam. 54 people were wounded, of whom 19 were Iranians."}

King disappeared February 25 while jogging in a park near Lake Hodges  in Escondido. A body believed to be King's was found Tuesday near the lake shore. DNA matching of semen found on the victim's clothing identified Gardner as a suspect, according to a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. Gardner was arrested Sunday near Lake Hodges.\nA preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for March 18.\nThe murder charge carries the special circumstance of being committed during a rape. Deputy District Attorney Kristen Spieler stated that the special circumstance makes Gardner eligible for the death penalty. The charges carry a penalty of 25 years to life if prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty.\nGardner is listed in California's registered sex offender database with a home address in Lake Elsinore, about 75 miles north of San Diego. He had been visiting his mother at her Rancho Bernardo townhouse at the time of King's murder.\nKing had planned on going on a run in Rancho Bernardo Community Park on the afternoon of February 25. Her family called police when she did not return home at dark. King's BMW was found in the park's parking lot, locked, with her cell phone and other belongings inside. Nothing indicated that anything violent had occurred in the vehicle.\nAbout 125 professionally-trained search-and-rescue volunteers combed through an area between the park and Lake Hodges. 6,000 other volunteers searched areas around North County, coordinated by the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center. Searchers found a body about 1 p.m. (13:00) local time (2100 UTC) on Tuesday, in a shallow grave about ten feet from a tributary that leads to the lake. The search had already covered that area but had missed the body. A diver searching the tributary spotted it from the water. According to San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore, there is a \"strong likelihood\" that the body is King's; however, the District Attorney's office does not plan to release positive identification until the preliminary hearing.\nSan Diego police say they have connected Gardner to a December 27 attack on a 22-year-old jogger in the same park where King disappeared. Gardner is also under investigation in the February 2009 disappearance of 14-year-old Amber Dubois in Escondido. In May 2000, Gardner was convicted of a forcible lewd act on a child and  false imprisonment. A 13-year-old female neighbor accused him of molesting her and  punching her repeatedly in the head.\nIn the 2000 case, prosecutors had originally charged Gardner with more-violent crimes that could have put him in prison for 30 years. They granted Gardner a plea agreement allowing him to be charged with lesser crimes  and receive a shorter sentence  in order to \"spare the victim the trauma of testifying\". With the reduced charges, Gardner faced 11 years in prison. The judge agreed to the prosecution's recommendation that the sentence be reduced to six years. Gardner served five years and was released in 2005. He wore a tracking device until his probation ended in 2008.\nDr. Matthew Carroll, the staff psychiatrist who interviewed Gardner in 2000 stated that \"the defendant takes no responsibility whatsoever for his actions...\" and that \"it is my opinion that [the defendant] would be a continued danger to underage girls in the community.\" However, Dr. Divy Kikani, a psychiatrist who had treated Gardner for bipolar disorder, said that Gardner was \"extremely remorseful\" and \"highly motivated\" to get help. A then-girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, and Gardner's mother all expressed support for him in the 2000 case.\nChelsea King's parents, Brent and Kelly King, are arguing for changes in sex offender laws following their daughter's death. Kelly King stated that current law \"lets every child in this country down.\""}

According to the document, food aid to Somalia is regularly diverted to a complex network of contractors for the United Nations within the country, who in turn have moved either the aid itself or monetary profits from the transportation of it to armed militant groups within Somalia.\nA part of the report said that \"A handful of Somali contractors for aid agencies have formed a cartel and become important power brokerssome of whom channel their profits, or the aid itself, directly to armed opposition groups.\"\nThe WFP, which is in charge of the aid, was heavily criticized for its actions regarding to Somalian aid, particularly the contracts for the movement of the aid, which the report claims are largely awarded to three Somali businessman who are alleged to have connections to militant groups.  The report also blames problems with the general distribution of aid in the country, where the lack of a functioning government has led to \"ineffective, disorganized and corrupt\" security forces.  It suggests that the only way to resolve these problems is to completely overhaul the aid system to break the control of aid by local forces.\nThe WFP has denied previous allegations of corruption and abuse in Somalia, but it said that it would investigate the findings of the new report. The programs' executive director also released a statement saying, \"The integrity of our organisation is paramount and we will be reviewing and investigating each and every issue raised by this report.\"\nAllegations that food aid was being diverted also arose last year, which led the United States to reduce funding to Somalia, for fears that aid was ending up with the Islamic group al-Shabaab.  Since then, the WFP has been banned by al-Shabaab from operating in Somalia, a move that followed the WFP's suspension of operations in southern Somalia amid attacks from militants."}

Despite Turkey's claims, Armenians have been heavily campaigning for the killings, which they say number up to 1.5 million, to be recognized as genocide, and over twenty countries worldwide have done so.\nSwedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that the vote would likely have a significant effect on the fate of negotiations between Turkey and Armenia, which have been attempting to resume normal diplomatic relations.

Monserrate had been found guilty in October of misdemeanor assault, in the criminal trial involving an alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo. A U.S. federal judge had previously upheld the expulsion, in a ruling issued in February.\nMonserrate was expelled from the New York State Senate on February 9 by a majority vote of his fellow senators. The result of the vote was 53 to 8 in favor of expulsion.\nIn the lower U.S. District court decision, federal judge William H. Pauley III denied a request to temporarily block the expulsion. A lawsuit had been filed by Monserrate, which had asked for a reversal of the former Senator's explusion and in addition sought a block on a March 16 special election for a replacement. The New York Civil Liberties Union supported Monserrate in the case. The former Senator argued that the act of being expelled from the Senate was not appropriate, as he claimed it violated due process.\nJudge Pauley ruled, \"the question of who should represent the 13th Senatorial District is one for the voters, not for this court.\" The judge explained that the voting rights of the citizens of the district formerly represented by Monserrate would not be significantly negatively impacted, due to the proximity of the upcoming special election  scheduled for March 16. Monserrate has stated that he will run in the special election, and he is not prohibited from doing so. \nMonserrate's opponents in the March 16 special election include Jose Peralta, a sitting member of the New York State Assembly and a Democrat, and Republican Robert Beltrani. According to WNYC, Monserrate has himself not received any official endorsements. Monserrate is running under a party name that he created, titled, \"Yes We Can\".\nThe district court's ruling determined that the expulsion by the New York State Senate was not inappropriate, stating, \"the power of a body to determine the fitness of its members is embedded in American democracy.\" Judge Pauley noted, \"Similar processes to discipline have long existed in deliberative bodies at all levels of government.\" New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo issued a statement February, in support of the ruling of the lower court. \"We are gratified that the Court has confirmed our position that the Senate had the authority to expel Mr. Monserrate,\" said the Attorney General. \nPrior to the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejecting Monserrate's appeal, the former Senator voiced optimism about the impending decision, \"They imposed a different standard on me without due process and I'm confident the court will rectify the violation.\"\nIn a statement given to the New York Daily News, Monserrate's attorney Norman Siegel said, \"We're naturally disappointed. We'll have more to say when we read the opinion.\" The hearing on Friday before the U.S. Federal appeals court lasted approximately one hour. During the hearing, one of the appellate court judges commented that Monserrate was aware that what he had done was, \"a crime, (and) youre not supposed to do it.\"\nMonserrate's misdemeanor assault conviction pertained to an incident where he dragged his girlfriend through the lobby while exiting his apartment building. He was acquitted by a judge of charges of felony assault. Felony conviction would have resulted in an immediate expulsion from the New York State Senate. \nMonserrate is the first politician to be expelled from the New York State Senate in almost a century. He is a former New York City police officer. Prior to becoming a member of the New York State Senate, he was a city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the alleged conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs.

Immediately after boarding the vessel, Bethune was detained by the Japanese crew and held on board the ship for a month before it returned to Japan, where he was arrested by a waiting Coast Guard delegation and placed into custody in Tokyo.\nThe arrest has generated great publicity in Japan, where public opinion is generally in favor of whaling, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is consistently criticized. Japan's whaling program, which the government says is a part of Japanese culture, results in the killings of around a thousand whales annually in hunts that the government claims are for scientific research. Activist groups such as Sea Shepherd, however, say that the program is a cover for commercial whaling, banned worldwide in 1986.\nA member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Paul Watson, captain of another anti-whaling vessel, said that he thought the arrest of Bethune would provide greater support for their actions.

Since its formation in 2001, the TNA had previously aimed for full independence for Tamil regions. The party also stated it would encourage non-violent civil disobedience in support of Tamil rights.\nSri Lanka's civil war has killed up to 100,000 people, after the Tamil Tiger rebel group began its armed struggle in 1983. The TNA had widely been viewed as a political wing to the Tigers. In 2009 the Sri Lankan government launched a major military assault against Tiger militants in the north of the country, which displaced around 280,000 people and provoked international controversy. However it succeeded in defeating the rebels, and led to the re-election of president Mahinda Rajapaksa this year.\nThe TNA, a coalition of various Tamil parties, currently holds 22 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament but has been weakened by the defeat of the Tigers. Since its formation in 2001 it has pushed for independence for the Tamil dominated regions of the north and east, but has had to avoid any direct endorsement of separatism, which would be considered illegal.\nIn the new manifesto, released on Saturday, the party also said that it would begin a civil disobedience movement in the style of Mahatma Gandhi. One section said: \"If the Sri Lankan state continues its present style of governance without due regard to the rights of the Tamil-speaking peoples, [we] will launch a peaceful, non-violent campaign of civil disobedience on the Gandhian model.\"\nThe parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are due to occur on 8 April.

Its main opposition the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which is the governing party of incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy, is predicted to be defeated. The election results, while marked by low turnout, strongly favored leftist candidates according to official returns. This has given the ruling right wing party a blow in the last nationwide election before the 2012 presidential elections. \nWhen 96% of votes had been counted, candidates from the Socialist and other leftist parties had won 53.6 percent votes according to the Interior Ministry. The conservative UMP party and other right-wing candidates won 39.8 percent. The far-right National Front outdid expectations with 12% of the vote. It seems to be favored by voters concerned about immigration and the growing Muslim population. According to polls the Socialists will win with a majority in the second round in all 26 regions of France. The Socialists already control twenty of the twenty two regions on the French mainland.\nSarkozy has dismissed this result as  regional voting, regional consequences, but indicated his intention to slow the pace of reforms and make a minor cabinet reshuffle. Prime Minister Franois Fillon said \"It's not over. Everything is open\" before the decisive runoff on March 21. He urged voters who missed the first round to come out for the second round, \"at a moment when the economic and financial crisis demands sang-froid, courage and unity.\" Jean-Franois Cop, a leader of Sarkozys parliamentary group said We had massive abstention  that is, an absolute record,. Sarkozy supporters argued that the triumphalism of the leftists had been tempered by the record voter abstention, on television debates.\nSocialist leader Martine Aubry, in a speech to supporters Sunday night, called the result \"encouraging\". \"By this vote the French people have sent a clear and strong message of refusal to a France that is divided, anguished and weakened,\" she said. She urged supporters to come out again next Sunday to give a win to hope that Sarkozy could be defeated in 2012. \nFormer Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius called it \"an excellent halftime for the Socialists,\" saying that voters wanted to voice their displeasure against Sarkozy's policies. He said the high rate of abstention indicated Sarkozy's failure to motivate citizens facing economic crisis and record unemployment. Sgolne Royal, expected to be Sarkozy's Socialist opponent in 2012 called this election \"a severe sanction vote\" against Sarkozy.\nThe 81-year-old National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said, \"The National Front was declared beaten, dead, buried by the president. This shows that it is still a national force, and probably destined to become greater and greater\". He appeared on national television after the vote, holding a poster banned by a court that reads: \"No to Islamism.\" He called on voters to back the party again in round two, saying his party was \"combative and capable of rebuilding this country, which is in a horrible state.\"  \nThe National Front has tied for third-place nationally with Europe cologie, the green-minded party campaigning about climate change, each winning 12 percent of the vote.\"Europe cologie is the third political force,\" in France, said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the party. It has frayed a \"tremendous path,\" he said. His candidates are expected to align with the Socialists in many regions for the runoff polls.\nSarkozy had promised reforms to make the economy more dynamic before he was elected in 2007. But he changed this free-market strategy when the financial crisis hit and called for \"moral capitalism\" and proposed limiting bankers' bonuses and global regulation of hedge funds. Sarkozy's successful intervention to keep carmaker Renault from outsourcing jobs to Turkey and stimulus packages failed to lower the 10% unemployment rate inviting anger of the French citizens and causing his approval rating to fall below 40 percent. He was not able to stop the numerous strikes and protests by factory workers in recent months. He also started the 'Burqa' debate on the basis of which the far-right National Front has succeeded.\nTurnout was estimated to be around 48 percent of France's 44 million eligible voters, a sharp drop from the roughly 60 percent who voted in 2004."}

He added \"We can do it in this country as most democracies do it: We'd have two chambers, both of which are elected but with the government accountable to the first chamber.\"\nThe Sunday Telegraph has leaked a plan which reveals that the 704 seats would be reduced to 300 seats and its members elected under a system of \"proportional representation\". This new chamber would no longer be known as the House of Lords and citizens will have the privilege to remove incompetent members through a \"recall ballot\". The paper reported that each member would serve up to fifteen years and one-third of the chamber would be elected during the usual general elections. The salary is reported to be around 65,000 per annum. All members should be UK residents and fully domiciled for tax purposes.\nThe Lords scrutinise and revise government legislation and are seen by the public as an undemocratic house or a place for the aristocrats and political appointees.  The chamber currently has around 740 members.  92 hold hereditary seats, and 26 are Church of England clergy.  The rest are appointed for life.\nFormer prime minister Tony Blair, with the 1999 House of Lords act, had expelled hereditary peers from the upper house, apart from the 92 permitted to remain in the House on an interim basis.  Another ten inheritors were created life peers to be able to remain in the House.  Lord Adonis commented that this expulsion had \"fundamentally transformed\" the chamber into a \"workmanlike assembly\".\nA spokesman for the Conservative Party (which is the opposition party) alleged that Labour was playing politics with the electoral system by introducing such proposals before the General election despite having thirteen years to reform the Lords.  \"We will work to build a consensus for a mainly elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords,\" he added.\nFor centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the 1999 Act removed such a right.  The Act decreased the membership of the House from 1,330 to 669.  The Labour Government is expected to present a bill to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House.  It also introduced in 2009 the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which would end by-elections to replace hereditaries, removing them by steady reduction instead of removing all of them outright."}

Commander Steven Drysdale was in charge of the nuclear-powered submarine in May 2008, when it struck a rock pinnacle 132 metres below the surface. A navigation chart showed the pinnacle, but Drysdale said that he had misread its depth as 732 metres.\nOfficer of the Watch Lieutenant-Commander Andrew Cutler and Navigating Officer Lieutenant Lee Blair were also reprimanded for their part in the incident by the court martial, held at the HMS Nelson centre at Portsmouth naval base.\nThe 32 million submarine was in the Red Sea, heading for the Persian Gulf, and was suffering from technical problems at the time which were slowing it down. The officers decided to dive from 100m to 250m, which would allow them to travel faster and reach their destination on time.\nAccording to prosecutor Captain Stuart Crozier: \"The three defendants all looked at the chart and the sub was taken to 250m. No thorough check was made to establish whether this depth was safe from obstacles.\"\nLieutenant-Commander Cutler then realised that a change to the route could shorten it. On assessing the chart, Officer of the Watch Cutler saw he could cut the corner of a dog-leg, saving about three to four miles,\" said Crozier. \"He then instructed the plot officer to draw a new line on the chart. However Lieutenant-Commander Cutler did not check the depth around this new track.\"\n\"Unfortunately, with the sub now dived to 250m, this new track went directly over a pinnacle which showed only 132m of available depth.\"\nThe new route was plotted directly over the pinnacle on the chart, and the court martial was told that this made it harder to spot the error. None of the officers, including Commander Drysdale, realised that they had put the vessel on a collision course.\nHMS Superb struck the pinnacle at 10.01 on May 26, suffering damage to its bow and sonar equipment. There were no casualties, but the submarine was forced to abandon its mission and return to the United Kingdom. It was decommissioned in September 2008, though the Ministry of Defence said that this was not due to the accident.\nCommander Alison Towler, representing Drysdale, said that he accepted full responsibility and had \"deep remorse and regret\" over the incident. \"He believes that due to the surrounding information he simply misread 132m as 732m\" she said. \"It was only later that he realised the plot officer had drawn the subs new transit straight through the pinnacle, which made it even harder for it to be seen.\"\nNavigating Officer Blair also pleaded guilty to failing to take into account all the dangers in or near the planned movements, and Officer of the Watch Cutler pleaded guilty to failing to supervise the plot officer adequately. All three officers will continue to serve in the Navy, but Drysdale has been moved to a desk job and will not be taking up the position in Washington DC he had planned to.\nCaptain Philip Warwick, president of the court martial board, told the three: \"It was indeed fortunate that no one was hurt and we note that the submarine could not complete its deployment in full. The failings were unacceptable and we take an extremely dim view of them.\"\nThe Royal Navy has since brought in new procedures on submarines to prevent a repeat of the incident, requiring that all depths are rechecked when plotting a new route."}

The contract was awarded to Boeing, which has since come under criticism for developing costly new technologies rather than using off-the-shelf systems.

The biggest announcements included abolishing stamp duty on homes under 250,000 for first-time buyers, whilst increasing it to 5% on homes over 1 million. In his statement to the House of Commons, the Chancellor claimed that the Labour government had made the right calls in countering the global recession, but warned that introducing cuts too early would jeopardise the recovery.\nOpposition leader David Cameron attacked the Budget, saying that the headline stamp duty plans were stolen from his own Conservative party. He criticised the amount of government debt, expected to be 167 billion this year, pointing out that it was more than every previous Labour government's borrowing added together. Cameron continued his call for spending cuts to decrease the deficit, saying it was time for a \"radical change of direction\". Darling however maintains that it is too soon.\n\"I know there are some demanding immediate cuts to public spending,\" said the Chancellor to the Commons. \"I believe such a policy would be both wrong and dangerous. To start cutting now risks derailing the recovery  which is already bringing down borrowing more rapidly than expected.\" This year's expected government debt is less than the 178 billion that was forecast in December 2009's pre-Budget report.\nThere will be an estimated 2.2% real terms rise in government spending this year, and several spending announcements were made. However Darling warned that cuts will follow after 2011, and could be \"the toughest for decades\". The Conservatives have said that if they win the upcoming election, they will introduce an \"emergency Budget\" less than 50 days after taking office. \nAmong the plans announced by the Chancellor today are a green investment bank to support renewable energy and low-carbon industries. This will have 2 billion, half raised by sale of government assets, including the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, and half raised from private investment. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds will also have to provide loans worth 94 billion to businesses, with small and medium sized companies receiving at least half of this. These companies will also have access to a new credit adjudicator to oversee banks' decisions on loans.\nThere will be a sharp rise of 10% in tax on cider, with wine, beer and spirit duties rising at 2% above inflation as planned. These changes will occur from midnight on Sunday, and tax on alcohol is set to increase a further 2% for two years from 2013. The previously scheduled increase in fuel duty will still happen, but will now be staggered over a longer period.\nOther changes include a freeze of the threshold for inheritance tax for the next four-years, whilst higher winter fuel payments for pensioners will be maintained for another year."}

An American official said that while \"we are still working to finalize the treaty,\" diplomats from both sides said they were optimistic that the deal was near completion.\nThe new-found optimism came after a recent breakthrough in negotiations, which have taken nearly a year, longer than either the Americans or Russians expected.  Originally, the treaty was to be negotiated in London of April 2009, but the completion date was then pushed back to December 2009, a deadline that passed with no deal.\nContentious issues in the negotiations included devising a way to make sure each side was complying with the requirements, the sharing of technology between the two sides, and how to limit defense programs in both countries.  While an original plan for an American defense system was abandoned by Barack Obama, a second plan presented by the US was also opposed by the Russians, which were pushing for language that would restrict the American nuclear program.  The final text will be composed of largely non-binding language recognizing the relationship between different types of weapons.\nUnder this text, both countries would be forced to reduce their deployed nuclear warheads to around 1,600, down from a current limit of 2,200.  The treaty would also require the arsenal of \"delivery vehicles,\" aircraft or missiles that can carry the warheads, to be halved to 800.  Arms-control advocates consider the reductions in the treaty relatively minor, but the Obama administration hopes to end negotiations with a simpler and more straight-forward treaty as a way to rebuild trust with the Russian government in preparation for more drastic changes in the future."}

In an interview with Wikinews, the WHO tells about the current H1N1 pandemic.\nThe organization's 93rd update as of March 26, 2010 states 213 countries, territories, and other communities have laboratory-confirmed cases and there have been at least 16,931 confirmed deaths, including 4,653 deaths in Europe and 7,673 in the Americas.\nWikinews reporter Mike Morales talks with Karen Mah, a media relations representative for the WHO, and asks her several questions.\n((Mike Morales)) Can you tell us what exactly H1N1 is and how it affects us today?\n((Karen Mah))  As of 21 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 16,931 deaths.  This number is a large underestimation of total deaths with total figures unavailable until a year or two after the pandemic is declared over. \n((MM))  How does the WHO feel the media coverage has been and does the WHO suggest any changes to coverage and if so, what kind?\n((Karen Mah))  WHO does not have any comment with regards to media coverage nor is it in our purview to suggest changes to coverage.  The pandemic is a global event and media coverage can't be characterized with any generalities.   \n((MM))  Which areas around the world are most affected by the pandemic and why?\n((Karen Mah))  Current disease activity and epidemiological activity indicates we are seeing the highest levels of activities occurring in Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. After a period of sustained pandemic influenza transmission in Thailand over the past two months, overall activity now appears to be decreasing. In West Africa, limited data suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Central America and in the tropical zone of South America, an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus has been reported since early March 2010 in an increasing number of countries. \n((MM))  What advice does the WHO recommend to any areas affected by H1N1? What does the WHO recommend to governments' health authorities of countries affected?\n((Karen Mah))  This is a very far-reaching question and answer and paraphrasing the pandemic preparedness guidelines is too simplistic.  I will refer you to this page [URL below] to see the whole spectrum of guidance for countries ranging from response, surveillance, reduction of spread, travel, hygiene etc.  From a WHO perspective, we have to offer the broadest range of guidance to cover developing, mid-level and developed countries.\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/guidance/national_authorities/en/index.html\n((MM))  What does the WHO recommend for those individuals affected by H1N1? How does H1N1 affect someone who is infected?\n((Karen Mah))  Since the H1N1 pandemic virus is now the dominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, most cases of influenza-like illness are likely pandemic influenza.\nTypical symptoms to watch for include fever, cough, headache, body aches, sore throat and runny nose.\nWHO advises health care providers to treat people with influenza-like illness based on their symptoms and the progress of their illness, and not to wait for laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza. The pandemic H1N1 virus has already spread worldwide.\nRegarding laboratory testing of cases, public health authorities and WHO partners continue to do selective testing of samples from patients with influenza-like illness to characterize outbreaks, monitor the virus and identify disease trends.\nAnti-viral drugs (which are medicines that act directly on viruses to stop them from multiplying) should not be taken to prevent H1N1.  There are two antiviral drugs are being used to treat pandemic influenza infections. These are oseltamivir and zanamivir, which both block the action of an influenza virus protein called neuraminidase.\nFor patients with symptoms of severe illness that are probably due to pandemic influenza, WHO recommends that treatment with oseltamivir should start immediately, no matter when the illness started and without waiting for laboratory results to confirm infection.\nFor patients at higher risk for serious disease from pandemic influenza, including pregnant women, children under age 5 and those with certain underlying medical conditions, WHO recommends treatment with either oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms, and without waiting for the results of laboratory tests.\nOtherwise healthy people who are not from a higher risk group but who have persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms should be treated with antivirals. These symptoms include difficulty breathing or a high fever that lasts beyond three days.\n((MM))  How does H1N1 affect someone who is infected?\n((Karen Mah))  Pandemic H1N1 virus is spread from person to person in the same way that seasonal influenza viruses are spread. It is transmitted as easily as the normal seasonal flu and can be passed to other people by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that can be inhaled, or that can contaminate hands or surfaces.\nSigns of the pandemic influenza are flu-like, including malaise, fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea.\nThe majority of people with pandemic influenza experience mild illness and recover fully without treatment. However, people should seek medical care if they experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or if a fever, and especially high fever, continues more than three days. For parents with a young child who is ill, seek medical care if a child has fast or labored breathing, continuing fever or convulsions (seizures).\nSupportive care at home with plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids and using a pain reliever for aches and pains is adequate for recovery in most cases. A non-aspirin pain reliever should be used for children or adolescents under age 18.\nThe public should be made aware that there are specific groups of people who appear to be at higher risk of more complicated or severe illness which include:\nCurrently, people age 65 or older are the least likely to be infected with the pandemic influenza, but those who do get sick are also at high risk of developing serious complications, just as they are from seasonal flu.\n((MM))  Is it known when the virus will become less virulent and cease becoming a major threat to health and of so when?\n((Karen Mah))  It is impossible to predict when the pandemic H1N1 virus will become less virulent.\n\n((MM))  Is there a significant risk of H1N1 mutating and becoming more deadly?\n((Karen Mah))  Influenza viruses constantly change through a process called antigenic drift.  All influenza viruses undergo this process but there is no way to predict if, when and how the pandemic H1N1 virus will shift.\n((MM))  Are the current anti-flu vaccines effective and how sufficient is the current supply? Can you explain how these anti-virus vaccine work and any possible side effects?\n((Karen Mah))  The current H1N1 vaccines are effective and supply is sufficient. The safety profile of H1N1 vaccines is very good.  Outcomes of studies completed to date indicate that pandemic vaccines have a similar safety record as seasonal influenza vaccines. Pandemic influenza vaccines underwent the same production and testing methods as seasonal vaccines.\nThe safety tracking of the vaccine for adverse events after its distribution and use worldwide has likely been the most thorough and sensitive in history.\nInfluenza vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.\nPossible side effects can depend on the type of vaccine, how it is administered and the age of the recipient.\nThere are two main types of vaccines: one is manufactured with inactivated viruses, the other uses live viruses.\nInactivated vaccines, administered by injection, commonly cause local reactions such as soreness, swelling and redness at the injection site, and less often can cause fever, muscle- or joint- aches or headache. These symptoms are generally mild, do not need medical attention, and last 1 to 2 days. Fever, aches and headaches can occur more frequently in children compared to elderly people.\nRarely, such influenza vaccines can cause allergic reactions such as hives, rapid swelling of deeper skin layers and tissues, asthma or a severe multisystem allergic reaction due to hypersensitivity to certain vaccine components.\nLive vaccines are given via a nasal spray, and can commonly cause runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, and can less frequently cause sore throat, low grade fever, irritability and head- and muscle- aches. Wheezing and vomiting episodes have been described in children receiving live influenza vaccines.\n((MM)) What action has the WHO taken, if any, to insure vaccines are available?\n((Karen Mah))  During the first stages of the pandemic in 2009, the Director-General highlighted the need to make vaccine and medicines available to countries who would be unable to access them on their own.  As the WHO pandemic vaccine donation programme was first established, all countries were surveyed by WHO, and 95 identified as having no access to pandemic vaccines, and therefore eligible for donations.\nBased on the pledges of donated vaccine, a plan was prepared for a two phase approach to supply sufficient vaccines for 10% of the population in these countries; an initial supply to cover health workers and other essential workers, equivalent to 2% of the population, and a second supply of 8% for other priority groups. The sequencing of supply was based on assessments of vulnerability to the pandemic, and readiness to utilize vaccines.\nTo date, 25 countries have received donated H1N1 vaccine totaling more than 10 million doses, along with ancillary supplies.   Another 15 to 20 countries will be receiving their vaccine shipments in the upcoming few weeks. \nThe 25 countries who have received shipments are: Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Fiji, Kiribati, Kosovo, Laos PDR, Maldives, Mongolia, Nauru, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Cuba, Honduras, El Salvador, Kenya, Samoa, Tokelau, Cook Islands, Pakistan, [and] Philippines\n\n((MM)) Last November, the WHO stated the H1N1 virus is world's most dominant virus. Is this still true?\n((Karen Mah))  On February 18th, WHO concluded a four-day meeting to look at vaccine strains for seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2010 and 2011 season.  This is part of the routine work that WHO does twice yearly to determine vaccine strains to be included in upcoming northern and southern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines.\nDuring the scientific discussions which ended on the 18th of February, it was confirmed that the overwhelming number of influenza viruses that were isolated around the world were the pandemic H1N1 virus.  The experts believe that based on this information that this virus will continue to be one of the dominant viruses in wide circulation in the coming fall and winter season.\n((MM)) Is there anything that the WHO believes to be very important for the public to know about the H1N1?\n((Karen Mah)) \n((MM))  Thank you for your time."}

It also commits the US to not develop new nuclear warheads, although the country's arsenal of conventional (non-nuclear) weapons will be maintained.\nThe document does, however, contain two major caveats.  Only countries that comply with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty are subject to the new limitations, meaning that India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan would be exempt from the limitations, as these countries are non-parties to the treaty, and Iran would be except while in violation of the treaty.  Also, the new strategy will maintain the option of reconsidering the pledge not to use nuclear weapons in retaliation to a biological attack, but only if it was judged that such technology had reached a point where the US was vulnerable to such an attack.\nThe revised strategy is expected to be controversial among both conservatives and liberals, who have, respectively, argued against reducing the power of nuclear weapons and advocated for a pledge to never initiate nuclear warfare. Obama called the new plan one that would enable the US to \"move towards less emphasis on nuclear weapons\" and that would \"make sure that our conventional weapons capability is an effective deterrent in all but the most extreme circumstances.\"\nObama held an interview at the White House about the new plans, in which he called the new strategy \"a series of graded options.\" He also said that \"Im going to preserve all the tools that are necessary in order to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.\""}

This comes on the heels of an historic treaty signed by American president Barack Obama, who along with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, pledged a systematic disarmament and draw down of nuclear warheads to a total of 1500 for each country, and laid out guidelines for the use of the remaining warheads. These guidelines did not rule out the option of nuclear weapons being used against Iran.

Both countries are estimated to have well over 2,000 warheads now. \nThe agreement also slashes by more than half the number of missiles, submarines and bombers that carry the weapons.\nThe pact replaces the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), which was signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in the final days of the Soviet Union. START I expired in December of last year. The treaty complements the other two nuclear arms reduction treaties signed by the United States and Russia, which where the 1993 Russia, which where the 1993 START II treaty and the 2002 Moscow Treaty also known as SORT.\nObama said the treaty is a big step forward for world security. \"Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation and for U.S.-Russia relations,\" he said.\nMedvedev said because of this treaty, the entire world community has won. The Russian leader said the year-long negotiations were tough, but hard work on both sides brought success.\n\"That enabled us to do something that just a couple of months ago looked like 'mission impossible.' Within a short span of time we prepared a full-fledged treaty and signed it,\" he said.\nObama says, in addition, that the treaty paves the way for future arms reduction talks with Russia, mainly on short-range nuclear weapons. \"This treaty will set the stage for further cuts, and going forward, we hope to pursue further discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons, including non-deployed weapons,\" he said.\nTom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, says the new treaty is significant in reducing the threat from U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, but more significant because it could lead to further cuts. \n\"We think we can even go to deeper reductions, and we hope they sign a new treaty after this one relatively soon. But this treaty is a great step forward, it is very important, and it puts U.S. and Russian arms control back on a firm footing, and, again, sets us up for deeper cuts,\" he said.\nThe signing of the \"New START\" treaty is one of several arms control developments taking place in several weeks. \nEarlier in the week, President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. nuclear policy. He said for the first time that preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism is at the top of the U.S. nuclear agenda. The threat of destruction by Russian warheads is now considered a secondary menace.\nUnder Obama's nuclear posture review, the U.S. pledges not to use nuclear weapons on non-nuclear countries that abide by their nonproliferation obligations.\nFrank Gaffney, a former arms control adviser to President Ronald Reagan, says the president's nuclear posture review is based on a false and dangerous premise. \"The idea that he can, by reducing America's nuclear arsenal, contribute to the universal abandonment of nuclear weaponry. It will not happen. It will not happen on his watch. It will not happen ever,\" he said.\nObama also plans to hold a conference on nuclear security next week in Washington, D.C..\nIn their hour-and-a-half meeting before the ceremony, President Obama urged Medvedev to support new U.N. sanctions against Iran for its refusal to stop enriching uranium. The Russian leader said the issue is not whether to impose sanctions, but what kind of sanctions.\n\"Smart sanctions should be able to motivate certain parties to behave properly, and I am confident that our teams that will be engaged in consultations will continue discussing this issue,\" he said.\nObama said, \"We are working together at the United Nations Security Council to pass strong sanctions on Iran and we will not tolerate actions that flout the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).\" He added, \"My expectation is that we are going to be able to secure strong, tough sanctions on Iran this spring.\"\nThe nuclear treaty is almost certain to be approved in the Russian Duma. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia reserves the right to drop out of the pact if it believes U.S. missile defense plans for Europe threaten its security.\nMany experts agree passage in the U.S. Senate is not as certain, but that its prospects are good. To ratify the treaty, it will require 67 votes, to pass it will require Republican votes. Republicans in the Senate have expressed concerns that too many restrictions have been placed on America's nuclear arsenal.\nHowever, Obama is confident the treaty will be ratified when asked during a press conference following the signing. Obama stated, \"And so I'm actually quite confident that Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, having reviewed this, will see that the United States has preserved its core national security interests, that it is maintaining a safe and secure and effective nuclear deterrent, but that we are beginning to once again move forward, leaving the Cold War behind, to address new challenges in new ways.\"\nObama also noted, \"[T]hat both in Russia and the United States, its going to be posed on the Internet, appropriate to a 21st century treaty.  And so people not only within government but also the general public will be able to review, in an open and transparent fashion, what it is that weve agreed to.\" Copies of the treaty and it's protocol have been posted on the State Department's website."}

Its recent statement advances the forthcoming review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to be held in New York next month. The declaration points out: \"Indeed, it is with a certain sense of relief we can state that since the mid-1980s, a large proportion of the more than 70,000 nuclear weapons have been reduced. Yet todays deployed nuclear weapons are still sufficient to extinguish modern civilization. In addition, nothing has changed about the fundamental inhumanity of nuclear armaments, because their use would affect military targets as well as civilian populations indiscriminately, and thus would be generally contrary to existing international humanitarian law, based on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.\"\nThe physicists are particularly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons, expecting \"that a regional use of nuclear weapons could become more likely if more states or even terror groups obtain access to weapons-grade fissile material\". Having a closer look to the continued work of weapon laboratories of the nuclear powers, they state: \"We cannot accept that nuclear weapons continue to be developed today.\" Strengthening the non-proliferation requires the \"nuclear powers to meet their responsibility for complete implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\", who pledged in its Article VI \"to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\".\nThe DPG addresses in its statement the perspective of a nuclear weapon free world as outlined by US president Barack Obama in his Prague's speech last year and that has been supported by Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev. Probably, the chances for the physicists have never been better before to achieve a complete abolition of nuclear weapons as it has been negotiated upon in the case of biological und chemical weapons. The continued development of such weapons of mass destruction appears to DPG and its members as \"inconsistent with the ethical principles to which we as scientists are committed.\""}

Sniffer dogs, for instance, who aren't accustomed to working at high sea levels, could have a harder time detecting living people buried beneath rubble.\nPower and telephone lines were also downed by the temblor, affecting communication, although the authorities commented that electricity and phone links have been repaired to tens of towns.\nChina's state media reports that troops garrisoned in the Yushu county, with help from locals, have already rescued over a thousand people buried beneath debris.\nResidents and troops garrisoned in the Yushu county have managed to pull out more than 1,000 people alive, according to Chinese state media. They are using shovels and bare hands.\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the weather: temperatures are freezing, and meteorologists predict sleet and wind to come within the next few days. Many people were forced to sleep outdoors, protecting themselves from the cold in blankets, or spending the night in vehicles.\nPierre Deve for the non-governmental organisation Snowland Service Group, was present in Yushu. He described the damage to Times Online, saying: \"There are corpses everywhere on the street. They dont have time to deal with them. There is a real need for medicine, for food, for water and for doctors. People are terrified that there will be another earthquake. They are also afraid that a dam that has been cracked will burst and flood the town.\"\nA local doctor, Karma Sherab, also commented on the problems the area is facing: \"Most of the hospitals have collapsed and others had become dangerous. The only thing we can do is to clean the wounds in a simple way or simply amputate instead of curing.\"\nChinese president Hu Jintao, meanwhile, said that he would be dispatching over 5,000 rescuers and soldiers to the scene of the disaster; the government has pledged over US$29 million worth of aid. Hu described the quake as being a \"huge calamity\". He is also shortening his visit to a summit in Brazil to return to his country. \"That is why I decided to bring forward my return to China,\" he said from Brasilia.\nPremier Wen Jiabao has visited Yushu to oversee relief work; he decided to delay a visit to southeastern Asia due to the disaster. \"As long as there is the slightest hope, we will make efforts that are 100-fold. Your disaster is our disaster, your suffering is our suffering.\"\nThe head of China's disaster relief department, Zou Ming, says that 120,000 articles of clothing, 120,000 quilts, food, and close to 40,000 tents were to be sent to the disaster zone; he encouraged people to donate money to assist in longer-term relief work.\nMeanwhile, some foreign countries have offered financial help; among them is Japan, which has pledged over one million dollars to disaster victims. The United States also said it is \"ready to assist\" if China requests international aid."}

{"id": 618, "ended": true, "text": "Current polls indicate that there is a high possibility that the general election of 2010 in the United Kingdom will result in a hung parliament. The polls, both independent and those conducted on behalf of political parties, predict that the Conservatives will win only 40% of constituencies, 10% short of that needed for a majority government.\nIn the UK political system, each of the constituencies, whose number rose from 646 for the previous election to 650 for the May 6th poll,  is represented by one Member of the House of Commons elected under a first-past-the-post-system. Under normal circumstances this usually favours one party, which if it wins over half of the seats, will hold a majority government.\nWith a working majority the ruling party can implement its legislative programme without the co-operation of opposition parties. However with small majorities party whips have to struggle to ensure that their backbenchers remain healthy, turn up for and actually vote in favour of their party's legislation; to prevent parliamentary rebellions the party leadership may need to moderate their policies or make concessions to factions within their own party.\nIf a party fails to gain the 326 or more seats needed for an outright majority, then the incumbent party is the first to be given the chance to attempt to form a coalition government by negotiating with the smaller parties.\nIn a coalition government the MPs of the junior partner are in effect taking the party whip of the senior party. Depending on how much their aid is needed, the junior party may gain in return some of the Minor Offices of State and some junior ministerships. The senior party may also adopt some parts of the junior party's manifesto or to abandon parts of its own. The stability of such coalitions will depend on how closely aligned the parties are politically, for example the Unionist parties and the Conservatives are traditional allies.\nIn normal circumstances the 'fringe' parties such as The Green Party, UKIP and the controversial BNP, would be of no consequence. Unlike the elections for the members of the European Parliament, which uses proportional representation, the support for these parties, though significant, is too widely dispersed to have an impact. However, due to the disaffection with the main stream parties caused by the Parliamentary expenses scandal, there is a possibility that one or two seats may fall to the minor parties.\nAs the third party in British politics, the Liberal Democrats would be the main target of negotiation, and their leader Nick Clegg has been described as a potential kingmaker, with electoral reformespecially the introduction of proportional representationbeing the traditional price for their support. However, after Labour Party reneged on their 1997 promise of electoral reform, they are unlikely to enter formally into a coalition with Liberal Democrats.\nIf the incumbent party is unable to negotiate a majority, then the party with the greatest number of seats is given the chance to form a government; this may be the incumbent party itself. If not, it will likewise attempt to negotiate with the smaller parties in order to gain a majority. It is only when this has failed that the party with the most seats may opt to govern as a minority government.\nA minority government would be constrained as to its ability to legislate. More specifically, it would not be able to enact legislation without either the formal support, usually with a quid pro quo, of the opposition parties. The minority government could also propose legislation that is attractive enough to tempt opposition backbenchers to defy their own whips and support the government. Although the situation may seem unattractive to the political parties, the inability of any party to make major changes without a consensus across the house makes it attractive to some voters.\nHowever, the instability and unpredictability of a minority government would be of concern to financiers who warn of further financial and economic troubles if such a regime came into power. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, suspects that it could to lead to social unrest like that in Greece in recent days. History has shown that the ruling party would find it impossible to work as a minority government, leading to an early general election.\nAlthough such calculations have not been part of Westminster politics since 1974, they have been prevalent in the devolved Scottish and Welsh legislatures. The Scottish Liberal Democrats formed a coalition with Labour in the first two sessions of the Scottish Parliament, and the Welsh Liberal Democrats were in coalition with Labour in the Welsh Assembly from 2001 to 2003.  \nEither way, whether the election results in a coalition or minority government, the possibility of the first hung parliament since the general election of February 1974 will be on the mind of at least the leaders of the political parties, if not the voters themselves."}

His comments included assurances that America was not abandoning space exploration, contrary to claims he was doing so after he announced the US's budget for 2011, which would have ended most of NASA's current projects, including the development of new heavy-launch rockets called the Constellation Program.\nUnder Obama's latest program, NASA would receive US $6 billion as supplementary funding over the next five years to develop new projects, which Obama emphasized, saying NASA was in the unusual position of having an expanded budget while other government agencies must comply to financial restrictions or cuts in efforts to reduce the US public debt. With the additional funding, NASA would extend the life of the International Space Station (ISS) by four years further, to at least 2020, design a new series of heavy-lift rockets by 2015, and continue development of the Orion crew capsule, a major part of the Constellation program.  Initially, the capsule would serve only as a rescue vehicle for the ISS, but would later serve as the \"technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions.\" The proposed project would also retain plans for private operators to service the ISS, despite criticism that such operators were not reliable enough for the task.\nThe centerpiece of the plan would be manned missions to the moon and beyond, beginning with missions to asteroids around 2025, with missions to Mars following within a decade. Initially, Mars missions would consist of sending humans to orbit Mars, with missions to land on the surface of the planet coming shortly after. Obama said that under the plan, \"we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.\"\nObama said that under his new plan, NASA would be able to achieve more in a shorter amount of time than it would have under the Constellation Program.  He also said that, contrary to fears that changes in NASA would result in job losses in Florida, where most space missions are launched from, under his new plan, a total of 2,500 jobs would be created in the area.\nThe new plan would, according to Obama, lead to \"major breakthroughs\" in the US space program.  He said that the goal of the new program would  be \"no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.\"  The president also emphasized the need for continued innovation, saying that \"weve got to do it [space exploration] in a smart way and we cant just keep on doing the same old things weve been doing and thinking thats going to get us where we want to go.\""}

Over half a billion cell phones are active in India, but only 366 million people there have access to a toilet.\n\"It is a tragic irony to think that in India, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones, about half cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet,\" commented Zafar Adeel, Director of United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health (IWEH).\nIndia's 545 million cell phones serve about 45 per cent of the population of more than one billion. Only 31 per cent (366 million) have access to modern hygienic amenities as of 2008. The United Nations University (UNU) recommends achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which aims to cut in half the number of people lacking safe water and proper sanitary arrangements. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), there would be a deficit of one billion people from that target aimed for 2015. \n\"Anyone who shirks the topic as repugnant, minimises it as undignified, or considers unworthy those in need should let others take over for the sake of 1.5 million children and countless others killed each year by contaminated water and unhealthy sanitation,\" Adeel added. \n\"Popular education about the health dangers of poor sanitation is also needed. But this simple measure could do more to save lives, especially those of young people, improve health and help pull India and other countries in similar circumstances out of poverty than any alternative investment. It can also serve as a very significant boost to the local economy,\" he said. \"The world can expect, however, a return of between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation, realized through reduced poverty and health costs and higher productivity  an economic and humanitarian opportunity of historic proportions.\"\nThe nine recommendations made by the UNU include changing the MDG target from 50 per cent by 2015 to 100 per cent coverage by 2025. Another suggested reform was to assign 0.002 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to improving sanitation. Approximately 358 billion dollars would be required to achieve that MDG target, considering that a toilet costs 300 dollars."}

He announced his candidacy for the 2012 race immediately following the 2008 election. Schriner refers to himself as the \"Average Joe\" candidate, and advocates a pro-life and pro-environmentalist platform. He has been the subject of numerous newspaper articles, and has published public policy papers exploring solutions to American issues.\nWikinews reporter William Saturn talks with Schriner and discusses his campaign.\n((William Saturn))  I was reading the January 2009 article In the 2008 presidential campaign, it was Joe the Plumber. In 2012, its going to be Joe the Painter from the Star Beacon , and it says that you're \"a former print journalist and addictions counselor who switched to house painting when he felt guided to run for president.\" Why did you feel guided to run for president?\n((Joe Schriner)) Ok, Joe the painter While the Star Beacon article was done quite well as a whole, the wording in this part about the presidency and house painting is a bit too abbreviated, and a bit too disjointed.  The more accurate version is I have a degree in journalism from Bowling Green State University and have worked for several intermediate sized newspapers in Ohio. A ways into this, I changed professions and became a licensed chemical dependency counselor who started one of the first outpatient treatment programs in the Midwest for people who were raised in addictive/dysfunctional families.  (As an aside, during Campaign 2000, I told CBS News in Monterey, that: To heal the country, we have to heal the family. [1]  After working in the chemical dependency field for about eight years, I felt a spiritual prompting  as other people at times feel spiritual promptings to do any number of things  to leave this profession and go out on the road to look for people trying to make a difference when it came to things like healing the family, saving the environment, helping the poor, creating peace [2]...I felt compelled to gather these stories, using my journalism background, then share them with others  with the hopes of planting seeds of change.  After a long, considered discernment process, I decided to go on the road and left  Cleveland, in 1990.  This was the start of an eight-year research period where I logged close to 100,000 miles.  What I learned was a lot of tremendously creative, common sense solutions to practically all the issues of our day.  Armed with this, I started to running for president in 1999, and have been doing it ever since (four successive election cycles).  In each newspaper interview, each radio show, each speech... I share parts of what I researched with the hopes people will try some of it in their own town, and who knows how far out it will ripple from there.  (I found that running for president is a great way to get a message out.  And yes, I am indeed trying to win as well. Then I could get the information out a lot quicker, and further.) Now as far as the house painting, because I'm on the road some six to eight months a year campaigning, it's logistically quite hard to hold down a counseling or journalism job. So, instead, I do some part-time house painting to make ends meet. And thus, Joe the painter. [3]   Note:  As an example, in the heart of Buffalo, I interviewed Dr. Myron Glick who felt his own 'spiritual prompting' to move his family to inner city Buffalo and start the Jericho Road Health Clinic.  He uses a minimal sliding fee scale and has seen people from at least 50 different countries (Buffalo is a port city).  Why?  Because he's Christian, he told me, and it is Jesus Christ' edict that we help the poor.  I have shared Dr. Glick's story all over the country, with the hopes of inspiring other doctors to consider doing some version of the same.  And each time that happens, I get a component of our healthcare bill passed  and another little kid living below the poverty line gets the medical help they might have otherwise not gotten.  For more on our healthcare position paper, see [4] or, listen to my Fireside Podcast on healthcare, and podcasts on other pressing issues of the day, at  [5]\n((WS)) When you announced your candidacy following the 2008 election, you remarked that this would be your final run. Why did you make that decision, and why did you announce your candidacy so early in the electoral process?\n((JS)) Given the strategy about using running for president as a way of getting a message out to help change America now, I always announce early and start hitting the road often just as early.  For instance, I was just on the front page of the LaGrange (GA) News talking about a project we'd researched (the Alterna Project) to provide long-term, affordable housing for new Hispanic immigrants in a community setting.  Now if I had walked in the doors of that newspaper, approached an editor and said:  Hi.  I'm Joe from Cleveland and I have some great ideas I'd like to share with you.  He/she would have looked at me, not like I was from Cleveland, but rather like I was from, oh, Mars...  Also being on the road early, gives me that much more time to continue my cross country research for our position papers, and such.  [6]  And it gives me more time to, well, campaign in general.  When you're short on Lear Jets and have to travel in a 1984 family camper, it just takes you a bit more time to get around.  America is a lot bigger than it looks on the map, I often joke.  And as far as this being our final run... we're planning on winning this time.  [7] Although it just occurred to me that when I win this time, I'll have to run again for a second term. They don't call me average Joe for nothing. (My wife Liz says Im sometimes a bit short on forward planning.)  For more about Liz [8]. \n((WS)) Back in 2000, Steve Chawkins with Ventura County News, wrote to you \"You won't win, you won't be president.\" Why do you believe you lost that particular election as well as the 2004 and 2008 elections? What have you done differently during this run?\n((JS)) Why I didn't win in 2000, 2004 and 2008?  I didn't get enough votes. (Sorry.) Actually, each election I have been somewhat quietly, and under-the-radar, going about meeting with people on the ground, giving talks, doing local media, putting up fliers...We do all the things the other campaigns do, only with a much smaller budget.  I recently told the Sun News in Lakewood, that this, indeed, is ...a serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president.  Yet as for the current state of election dynamics in America, we're up against this huge Goliath(s), and our 'sling shot and stone'  if one allows that metaphor  will be sparking a grassroots revolution.  But for this to happen, and for this to become a national story with staying power (and not a 15-minutes-of-fame national media blip), people would have to know that there has been tremendous depth and breadth to the research and campaigning. (As just another example, I have traveled more than 80,000  miles campaigning in the past 11 years.  And I might well be the most well traveled presidential candidate (domestic road miles) -- in the history of U.S. politics.)  [9]  So as to what we'll do different in this election?  Not much.  I intend to stick to our back road to the White House strategy [10] , continuing to go from town to town  waiting for that long caravan  both literally and metaphorically  to start lining up behind us.   \n((WS)) In some sources it says you are running for the Green Party nomination, while in others it says you are running as an Independent. Let's clear this up, are you running for any particular party's nomination, or as an Independent?\n((JS)) I have primarily run as an independent candidate during these four election cycles.  And I am currently running as an independent candidate now.  However, in 2007 I vied for the presidential nomination with the Green Party. [11]  I didn't get their nomination, yet I continued to run in the 2008 election as an independent candidate.  For campaign 2012, I might vie for the Green Party nomination again, once their Primary process starts.  Or, and this is another possibility, there has been some talk over the years of a fusion candidacy among Third Parties.  That is, say, the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party... would all get behind a single presidential candidate to increase the chances of a Third Party candidate winning.  If this evolves, I would consider vying for that kind of candidacy as well.  Running with a Party increases your chances of getting ballot access exponentially.\n((WS)) How large is your campaign?\n((JS)) In comparison to the size of most major two Party campaigns, I once told a network news show in Indianapolis, in response to a similar question about our size:  Think the movie Hoosiers.  This, by the way, played well in Indiana.\nHas your campaign received any notable endorsements?\n((JS)) Bill Samuels, president of the organization Consistent Life, has personally endorsed us in several campaigns.  (Consistent Life embodies valuing the sanctity of life at all stages from the womb to the tomb and is a network uniting organizations and individuals who support a consistent life ethic.  Their issues revolve around improving a spectrum of issues from poverty, to healthcare, to abortion, to global warming... and anything else that has the potential to end life prematurely.)  [Schriner] is a Christian who is running as a consistent life ethic candidate.  He is right on all the life issues on which Obama is wrong, Samuel wrote in 2008    Then there have been the media endorsements.  Some examples:  ...he (Schriner) seems to make a lot more sense than most politicians I try not to listen to.  Steve Zender, editor, The Progressor-Times newspaper, Carey.  Isn't our generation ready to truly make our world better?  The first step?  Vote for Joe!  Leah Beth Bryson, columnist for The Vision student newspaper, Lambuth University.  A lot of what Joe says really would come across as good, common sense to many Americans.  They would gladly have someone like him leading the country...  --editor David Green, The Observer, Morenci.  Then there have been all the 'average Joe' endorsements  'notable' to us  from around the U.S.  The following are a smattering of excerpts from a few of these comments (which came in e-mails and letters):   Just wanted you to know that I'm really impressed with all the research on a variety of local initiatives Mr. Schriner has done.  I was looking for a candidate I could actually support, and I found one here.  --Iowa.  I had been searching for a candidate with a consistent life ethic, a commitment to actively working for peace and justice, and concern for the environment... I will happily support you at the voting booth today.  Washington.  I was tired of not voting for someone, but rather against the other main candidate.  --Ohio  My conscience will be clear when I leave the voting booth... and I approve of this message. --Georgia.

How do you spend your time?\n((JS)) When I'm on the road campaigning, my day looks something like this.  (Incidentally, we often move from town to town daily, where versions of this template repeat over, and over, and...).  First, we generally get up early and either go to Mass, or do family prayer.  Then after breakfast (often oatmeal), Liz starts to do homeschooling  or as we colloquially refer to it: motor-home schooling  with our three children.  [13]  Meanwhile I'll go, often unannounced, to a local newspaper (radio stations, TV stations...) and inform them about a corner whistle-stop event we'll be doing at noon in their town.  Sometimes they'll have me stay to do an interview right then, other times they'll send a reporter to the event.  Around 10:30 a.m., we'll go to a local library where Liz will continue with the homeschooling and I'll update our campaign website blog about the events of the day before.  [14]  Shortly before noon, we'll arrive at the downtown venue where we'll unfurl banners, flags and go into street corner whistle-stop mode.  We'll wave and call out to passing motorists, the kids and I will walk about passing out fliers, our young Jonathan will try to get passing truck drivers to honk...  It's all rather festive.  Afterward we do media interviews, [15]  then head out to lunch at Taco Bell, or wherever.  After some Dollar Menu bean burritos, we'll take the kids to a park or local YMCA where we all exercise a bit.  Afterward, a variety of things might happen.  Sometimes we go door-to-door in a town passing out fliers and putting them up in downtown businesses as well.  Other times, there's a brief window of time in the late afternoon, and early evening, to write the speech for an event we're doing later that night.  Other times we'll take the kids to, say, a Little League ballgame early in the evening.  And as they watch the game, I go about passing out campaign literature and talking with folks.  Other evenings, we're meeting with supporters in their homes, or I'm out doing research on one of the projects we've come across, or for that matter, I'm sometimes out throwing the football around with the boys... Then, as the evening starts to wind down, we'll look for somewhere to park  whether a campground, church parking lot, Wal-Mart parking lot...  And as the kids settle in, we tell stories from the road, or read the kids a book, or the kids will draw, write letters, do Lego stuff on their own...  We then say evening prayers together as a family before the kids go to sleep.  And finally, Liz and I will often stay up late playing Scrabble, or talking about the day, or working on the scheduling and itinerary for the next several stops.  Or some nights, after a day of, well, too close quarters with the kids, Liz and I will simply sit and stare out the camper windows, in silence.  Silence that is only occasionally broken by an exhausted Liz, or an exhausted me, repeating the refrain:  I think we need a staff.\n((WS)) If you had complete power at this moment, what would you do? How would you change America?\n((JS)) If this means complete power, as opposed to having to deal with the checks and balances built into our federal government, this is some of what I'd do:  I'd end abortion and all the precipitating factors leading to it (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...).  I'd mobilize a set of dramatic initiatives to, not just curb global warming, but to actually start to reverse it.  I would unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons.  I'd stop the production of nuclear energy.  (Anybody hear of Chernobyl?)  I would grant amnesty and family reunification to illegal immigrants.  [16]  (During a talk at an immigration rally in Arizona several years ago, I said we walked through the slums of Juarez, where violence is off the charts and many of the children are extremely hungry.  If I was their parent, I'd do everything I could to get these children out of harms way and get them something to eat  even if it meant risking crossing the border illegally.) I would end the death penalty.  Also in Arizona, I read a newspaper story about a death penalty protester who posed:  Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?  Good question.  I would increase, exponentially, American foreign aid (it is currently only 4% of the budget) to try to help stem world hunger much more  24,000 people starve to death every day in the world  and to help realize Habitat for Humanity's goal of providing adequate housing, (for every person in the world.)  I would bring peace to urban war zones around the country. [17]   (In part of this effort, our family moved into a dangerous part of Cleveland, Ohio, to be part of the solution.)  I would end homelessness.  (We take homeless people into our home.  And we will be doing the same in the West Wing.  I mean the Lincoln bedroom is free, as an example.)  I would tremendously jack down and simplify the economy, shifting America back to much more of a local production for local consumption orientation, like it was in the old days.  I would mobilize efforts for a tremendous come back of the small family farm and the practice of growing organically.  This was once the backbone of our country, I told the newspaper Country Today in Wisconsin.  And it should be again. [18]  I would get people to tighten their belts and pay off the National Debt so our children don't inherit it.  During a talk at the University of Notre Dame recently, I said I would redirect the technical smarts at NASA toward coming up with better water filtration systems, solar panels, wind turbines..., as opposed to working on things like going to space destinations where we: can't breathe the air, there's no gravity and there's no food! That might be, oh, a hint God doesn't want us there, I said.  I would give some of the land back to the Native Americans so it's equitable, like it should have been from the beginning.  [19] And I would give the African Americans tangible reparations for past atrocities and the ongoing trans-generational problems slavery caused.  And, I would ensure  as impossible as this seems  that the Cleveland Browns had a winning season, soon...  For a look at how I would actually try to make a lot of this happen, the Cleveland Browns notwithstanding, go to my rather extensive position papers at [20]\n((WS)) When you say \"we are left of the Green Party, does that mean you view yourself as a socialist?\n((JS)) No, I'm not a socialist.  In the article you allude to, I made that comment (as I often do) in relationship to being left of the Green Party when it comes to the environment.  And that's hard to do.  If fact, I told the Freemont Messenger newspaper in Ohio that when it comes to helping the environment, no Party even comes close to matching the Green Party.  I have merely used the 'left of the Green Party' thing to illustrate how serious we are about the environment.  During a Third Party presidential candidate debate at the National Press Club in Washington, I said that our family had established a Kyoto Protocol Home Zone.  We don't use air conditioning, cut the thermostat back in the winter, dry clothes on the line, recycle practically everything, live simply with few material items, bicycle or walk practically everywhere within a five-mile radius of our home, use lights sparingly...  And at the White House, we'd be doing the same. Not to mention, there would be solar panels and a wind turbine on the White House roof.  Our point being that we can't wait for something more tangible than the Copenhagen Accord at this point, but rather the time for each American to voluntarily act on this is: now!  Note:  We have traveled extensively looking at things like a wind turbine installation in Mandan; a geothermal home installation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ($17 heating bill in: January); a Southwest Sustainability Project for retrofitting homes with insulation and alternative energy... And our administration would attempt to move America away from being the leading 'Society of Consumers' in the world, to be the leading 'Society of Conservers.'  I mean if we're going to lead, why not lead in the right way  for our kids and for future generations. At the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, I interviewed Winona LaDuke.  Ms. LaDuke is an Ojibwe Tribe member who ran for vice-president with Ralph Nader in Campaign 2000.  She said her tribe believes they are environmentally responsible for the next: seven generations.\n((WS)) As a former addictions counselor, would you like to see some prohibitions on the sale of alcohol? Would you consider yourself a member of the temperance movement?\n((JS)) I would, indeed, be an advocate for temperance (more responsible drinking); but not for a return to prohibition. At the outset, let me draw some parallels to smoking.  It was determined that smoking was hazardous to one's health.  (Currently more than 160,000 people die of lung cancer each year, as an example.)  Then there are other smoking related respiratory issues (like emphysema), and second hand smoke issues, and...  In light of all this, anti-smoking campaigns gained incremental traction over the past 50 years.  These led to eventually getting cigarette smoking ads banned in many media and created a climate favorable for significantly increased taxes on cigarettes.  (President Obama just signed a law increasing federal tax on cigarettes from 32 cents a pack to $1 a pack.) And a wide variety of programs started up to alert youth about the dangers of smoking.  As a result of all this, fewer than 20% of adult Americans still smoke, according to a recent Time Magazine article.  This figure is down significantly from when the campaign started...  Now, while again, I'm not advocating prohibition, common sense says you have to look at the level of drinking in our society at this point  and how destructive it's becoming.  As a former addictions counselor, I did indeed see the destruction alcohol can wreak.  It lubricates things like domestic violence between spouses, child abuse, broken families...  During our cross country research, I also interviewed Mark West, who started a cutting edge two-year treatment model for recovering alcoholics and addicts in prisons nationwide.  He said 80% of prisoners these days have committed crimes under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or were trying to get money for alcohol or drugs when they committed the crime(s).  Then there are all the alcohol related traffic fatalities and maiming.  Then factor in all those alcoholics who have died of cirrhosis of the liver, or have hemorrhaged to death internally from alcohol addiction, or who have committed suicide under the influence.  And add to all this, the number of people in mental institutions with wet brains and other mental health complications from alcoholism.  In essence, the numbers with all this are staggering.  And by comparison, because of the tremendously broad ramifications, alcohol abuse has a much more wide sweeping effect on society than smoking...  So, like with cigarettes, our administration would push for things like a significant jump in taxes on alcohol.  The higher costs, like with cigarettes, will curtail some drinking.  Like with what happened with smoking, we would also push for banning drinking ads in the media (There is currently more money spent on ads for alcohol, than on any other product in America.)  Another strategy that we're looking at is proposing: drinking licenses.  Seriously.  A former bartender in Columbiana County, proposed this to us.  For instance, he said just like with getting a driver's license, there should be a written test for a drinking license.  It would cover such topics as how many drinks it takes approximately to move one's blood alcohol level over the legal limit in a state.  Another set of questions might include identifying the signs and symptoms of alcoholism.  In the event of, say, a DWI, or other criminal offense (robbery, domestic violence...) involving alcohol, a person's drinking license could be revoked for a period of time.  And if he/she was caught drinking during this time, more penalties would be levied.\n((WS)) Your Pro-Life stance seems to be a big issue in your campaign. What are your thoughts on Scott Roeder, who assassinated George Tiller? Was this action justified? How far are you willing to go to end abortion?\n((JS)) I believe abortion is a form of murder.  And I told the Range News in Wilcox, that with abortion American society has become its own worst terrorist.  During an abortion, a baby is systematically dismembered in the mother's womb, then suctioned out.  I mean, c'mon!  Yet even with all this (some 4,000 abortions a day in America now), I don't condone the George Tiller killing.  Because, well, it's yet another 'killing.'  As I mentioned earlier, I don't believe in the death penalty in any form  even a pro-life vigilante one.  I give talks all over the country explaining that I believe that if pro-life people really want to end this evil, they need to organize  much better than they are now  and take to the streets en mass, day in and day out, the same as what was mobilized in the South to end the evil of Segregation.  (We've reached the 50 million abortion mark since 1973.  That's staggering!)) People should regularly be out with protest signs, not just in front of abortion clinics, but in their neighborhoods.  As we've traveled, our family has protested on neighborhood street corners and in front of abortion clinics in California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida, North Dakota...  And we'd be doing the same as the First Family, I told the Lewiston Argus newspaper in Montana.)  What's more, the newspapers should be flooded with an avalanche of pro-life letters to the editor.  Legislator offices should be deluged with pro-life letters.  A lot of people in the South didn't want Segregation to end, but they wanted the protests to end even more.  So, eventually, Segregation ended. It could well be the same with abortion.  Note:  As I mentioned earlier, I would also work stridently to help end precipitating factors (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...) that lead to many abortions.  As I would work to highlight models for the many crisis pregnancy centers we've researched across the country.  Centers that provide food, shelter, clothing, college scholarship money, day care... for moms (and dads) who want to keep their baby. Weve researched these centers in Minnesota, Indiana, Rhode Island For more on our stance on abortion, see:   [21]  or for a more in-depth paper, see [22]\n((WS)) What are your thoughts on President Obama?\n((JS)) Mixed.  Given, for instance, my stance on abortion (last answer), I find Mr. Obama's strong backing of abortion extremely troubling.  Conversely, I find his efforts toward scaling back nuclear weapons, cutting down on greenhouse gases, getting more access to healthcare for individuals... as commendable (and in line with the Consistent Life Ethic I espouse).  I would, however, push for much stronger action on each of these fronts.  (Granted President Obama might have as well in some of these categories, but, as has been the case with healthcare, he has been hamstrung to a degree by Congress.)  I do disagree with the president's troop surge strategy in Afghanistan.  I believe this will lead to a situation analogous to what essentially devolved into the 'Iraq quagmire.'  And I believe the stepped up drone attacks in the mountain region between Pakistan and Afghanistan is a mistake, considering all the civilians being killed.  (What we so often refer to as a war's inevitable collateral damage, is: children, moms, dads...)  Admittedly however, when it comes to both Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Obama inherited tremendous dilemmas, with no easy solutions.  On the environmental/energy front, I strongly disagree with Mr. Obama's plans for more drilling offshore in the Atlantic, and promoting a new generation of nuclear energy plants...  For more on our energy policy, see: [23]  In regard to personal characteristics, I do admire Mr. Obama's tenacity, which was demonstrated graphically in the last election process and with his relentless pursuit of the healthcare bill. An addendum:  There has been much written about Mr. Obama's oratory skills and negotiating skills.  Yet I believe this has to be weighed in the context of:  Is he saying the right stuff?  Is he negotiating for the right stuff?  In my opinion, not always.\n((WS)) What are your thoughts on the Tea Party movement?\n((JS)) I just recently read a Newsweek article about the Tea Party.  An excerpt that particularly caught my eye was:  The Tea Party rejects the idea that ...a government of brainy people can solve thorny problems through complex legislation.\"  The Tea Party finds its strongest spirit among conservative Republicans.  Yet a powerful current of 'blame both sides' also pulses through the movement.  Lynne Roberts, a volunteer organizer of a Tea Party gathering in Albany, New York said:  We're equally disgusted with Republican and Democrat Congressmen.  ...The day I was answering this question for this article, I was also interviewed by the Americus (GA) Enterprise newspaper.  I said when you objectively step back from society and take a lookwe have a mess.  We have a $13 trillion National Debt and we are mired in a deep recession.  We have just crossed the 50 million abortion threshold.  Global warming looms as a scary doomsday scenario.  Violence and poverty are almost off the charts in many of our big city urban cores.  Our prisons are bursting at the seams.  Children are being shot in schools and abducted from the streets  And one of the main common denominators in this:  For the last couple decades, we've had 'brainy' presidents who have come out of Yale or Harvard.  So what does this say?  I believe it says that, apparently, the education one receives at Yale or Harvard (while impressive to many), isn't the type of education that equips people to, well, solve many of the societal problems I just mentioned.  I mean if it was... I told the reporter in Georgia that to solve the National Debt problem, for instance, we need a common sense president  with a calculator that works.  Im serious.  But it's not just the presidents (Congress people, Wall Street bankers, corporate CEOs...), it's us, the American people.  We have gotten ourselves into this mess.  We're in this global warming crisis, as an example, not because the politicians failed to come up with tangible measures at carbon dioxide reduction in Copenhagen; but rather because many of us are failing here.  We drive too much, use too much air conditioning, heat too much, buy too much (it takes the burning of fossil fuels to make the products)...  We're a society addicted to comfort and immediate gratification.  And what's more, just like an alcoholic, we don't want our politicians confronting us about it.  So we elect people who don't confront us  and the dysfunction (read: destruction) continues.  For a candid look at what we propose for global warming, see: [24] and  [25]\n((WS)) Which historical figure do you most identify with and why?\n((JS)) George Plimpton.  He was a rather famous sports journalist who was known for 'walking a mile in an athlete's shoes.'  For instance, he spent a spring training practicing with the Detroit Lions and even played quarterback for several downs during an exhibition game.  He then went on to write the book: Paper Lion from the experience.  And that's how I've been, to a degree, as a presidential candidate.  That is, I try to live the platform I espouse.  For instance, as part of our urban platform, we exhort some people in suburban and small town America to roll up their sleeves and move into the urban cores of LA, Chicago, Minneapolis... to work on systemically changing things.(Just throwing more money and police presence at the problem is like metaphorically putting a band aid on something that needs major surgery.)  Taking our own advice  in a very 'Plimpton-like' manner  our family moved from Bluffton (pop. 3,857 and think Mayberry) to a hardscrabble part of Cleveland (the poorest big city in the country).  We moved into a block where a group of Catholic Workers were living every 3rd or 4th house down from each other.  There we all helped transform an old asphalt parking lot into an urban farm, volunteered at a drop-in center for the marginalized up the street; coached Rec. Center soccer and baseball teams (many of the kids not having dads at home) [26]  and [27] ...  Besides participating in the transformation of this area, like George Plimpton again, I wrote a book about the experience titled America's Best Urban Neighborhood...[28]  We also, as another example, promote an agricultural platform that would push for the return of the small family farm, en mass. And as we traveled the country, not only did we research the various dynamics of the family farm, but our family worked on a number of them as well.  This included chores like chopping wood, bailing hay, weeding by hoe in an organic bean field  And these were not 20-minute photo-ops, so to speak.  These were long, sweaty days out on the farm.  The essence of my candidacy has been being on the ground and working side-by-side with ordinary folks, listening to their thoughts, translating them into positions  Ours, truly, is an American peoples platform.  Note: While not a bona-fide historical figure (more fiction, but you wish he was real), I also identify with: Rocky.  [29]  Some may feel its another Rocky Balboa story about an Ohio man against the millionaires.  -- Alban Mehling, Associated Content\n((WS)) Could you take this test, and let us know where you stand on the political spectrum?\n((JS)) On the test, I scored as a centrist.  (Surprised me too.)  \n((WS)) Anything else you want to add?\n((JS)) Anything else I want to add  My wife Liz and I are running for president as concerned parents from the Midwest.  What were concerned about is the alarming increase in climate change, the scary levels of nuclear proliferation (including in this country, even with the new treaty with Russia), mounting violence in our inner cities and stark abject poverty in the Third World.  Then theres astronomical national debt, 4,000 babies being killed in their mothers wombs here each day, endless war, terrorism  During Campaign 2004, I told a newspaper reporter in La Cross, that I didnt want to be sitting on my death bed someday, staring our children in the eye and saying:  I knew all this stuff was going on, but I was too busy making money.  So our family gave up our normal lives and took to the roads of America to look for solutions to these dilemmas.  And we found them, in the most unlikely of places at that.  We found how to balance the National Budget in tiny Atwood (pop. 1,500).  We found how to stop abortion in Portland.  We found how to end nuclear proliferation in Luck.  We found how to stop terrorism in w:Comers, Georgia. And we found how to realign most of the rest of America in Bluffton (pop. 3,857), Americas best town. [30]  and [31]  And as these were the most unlikely of places, the people behind the projects were often the most unlikely of people.  That is, they were often common sense people with the common good in mind.  Not profit.  Not fame.  Just the common good.  Weve done, maybe, more than 1,000 interviews with these types of people.  And from these interviews, as I mentioned before, weve developed a solid platform.  The best platform out there for where the country needs to go at this point, we believe.  You see, in the face of all the pressing problems I describe at the outset of this particular answer, a lot of the current policies seem to me to be rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.  What we need is leadership at this point that can steer the boat away from the iceberg altogether, and quick.  (That is, ironically enough, if theres going to be any icebergs left in the wake of global warming.)  Our common sense platform does that, in spades.  So Americans have a choice this next election.  They can go with yet another Ivy League type choice, contemplating the refrain:  If you always do what youve always done, youll always get what youve always got.  Or they can go with this quite average family from Cleveland, who will bring good old fashion common sense (think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) to a White House that will look, oh, a bit differentincluding perhaps even the color.  I mean knowing my wife (soon to be First Lady), shell have me painting stuff there on the weekends.  Im thinking about going with, like, a soft green on the outside. [32]  --Joe  P.S. Dont let the occasional humor fool you.  This is, indeed, a very serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president.  And wouldnt it be refreshing if someone like me won?"}

The agency said more than half of Europe's average 28,000 daily flights were cancelled yesterday, twice as many as were called off on Thursday.\nIn a special report, Wikinews takes a look at how different countries have been affected by this event.\nAll of Germany's sixteen airports with international flights have been shut down today, including the busy Frankfurt airport. A spokesman for carrier Lufthansa says all of its flights were cancelled until no sooner than 20.00 local time (18.00 UTC). He said that there were no planes from the airline in the air anywhere on the globe. \"There has never been anything like this,\" he said.\nIcelandic airports are open, despite being in such close proximity to the billowing volcano, as the winds are blowing ash clouds away from the vicinity.\nThe Icelandic Met Office's Matthew Roberts, told the BBC that the volcano hasn't been expending as much ash, and that the eruption was slowing down.\nIcelandic officials are urging local residents with respiratory problems to refrain from going outdoors, and encourages the use of protective goggles and masks to those who do go out.\nMost disruption in the country has actually been to ground, not air, traffic. Local police chief Kjartan Thorkelsson commented: \"We had to close roads because of the ash yesterday [Thursday], even though it was not very thick.\" He added that the ash \"is particularly dangerous for animals, since it can go into water and the grass they eat, [but] [i]t is not as dangerous to humans\".\nExperts suggest that occasional disruptions are possible throughout the next half year, should Eyjafjallajokull continue to erupt. Another concern is that it may trigger an eruption from the larger Katla volcano nearby, which has occurred every time Eyjafjallajokull has erupted for the past few centuries.\nEven countries as far away as Japan were affected by the ash clouds. A correspondent for the BBC, in Tokyo's Narita Airport, says that many travellers en route to Europe had to spend the night in the departure lounge because their flights were cancelled: \"Airlines have handed out sleeping bags and blankets but there have been complaints there aren't enough to go round. The longer the airports are closed the longer the backlog of passengers builds up,\" he reports.\nPolish authorities have suggested that they will delay the funeral of deceased president Lech Kaczynski, who died in a plane crash in Russia last week. Many world leaders planning to attend the funeral might be prevented from doing so due to the ash clouds. Poland was one of twelve to close down most or all of its airspace.\nThe president's family, however, has insisted the ceremony, to be held in Krakow, proceed as planned.\nThe UK's National Air Traffic Service (NATS), says that its restrictions on airspace in the country would remain in effect until no sooner than 13.00 UTC today. Travel bans for Northern Ireland and Scotland have been lifted, although NATS stressed that this does not necessarily mean flights to and from the area will actually resume.\nRyanair, meanwhile, cancelled all its northern Europe flights until 13.00 on Monday. British Airways called off all of its flights from London airports.\nUK ferry operators saw a jump in bookings as stranded air travellers sought other ways to cross the English Channel.\nA spokesman with the British Civil Aviation Authority commented that, [i]n terms of closure of airspace, this is worse than after 9/11. The disruption is probably larger than anything we've seen.\" \nA correspondent for Al Jazeera reporting from London Heathrow airport described stranded travellers' attitude as being \"increasingly frustrated\". He remarked: \"Some sources I've been speaking to have been indicating that this will probably be extended further. There may be intermittent disruptions to flights for months to come.\"\nThe Icelandic volcano may cause the US to experience volcanic sunsets. Vulcanologist Jay Miller claims, \"Once it stops erupting it will take a few days to settle out. As long as there's ash in the atmosphere or any pollutant for that matter, you'll see these alterations in the color we see in the sky.\"\nBrian Toon of University of Colorado, Boulder, says: \"It's unlikely any of this volcanic ash will get as far as the United States. But it is possible. It's just rare. It's likely the stuff will get washed out before it ever gets here.\"\nAmerican Airlines, in the meantime, announced it had cancelled 56 of its flights to and from Europe today, and the same amount yesterday; countries to which flights were not called off were Italy and Spain. US-based airlines make 337 flights between Europe and the US daily; of those, 280 were cancelled yesterday, the Air Transport Association of America says.\nThe Icelandic volcano has not caused many problems in Chile. SCL reported to El Mercurio that just a flight has been cancelled. The flight was operated by Air France, that may had went at the 16:00 local time to France. \"We don't know if this suspended flight will go, yet,\" SCL reported, and warranted that \"Air France is not going today.\" SCL also stated that has not been cancelled any other flights, but that could change as the time goes by."}

They were fined 112 million and 50 million respectively.\nThe supermarkets facing the largest penalties were Asda and The Co-operative Group, at 14 million each. Other stores fined were First Quench, Morrisons, Safeway, Shell garages, Somerfield, T&S Stores (now One Stop) and TM Retail. Also taking part in the price fixing were Sainsbury's, though they received immunity from being fined after alerting the OFT and co-operating with the investigation. Some of the other companies also earned reductions in their fines through co-operation with the OFT.\nSimilar allegations against Tesco were not pursued due to a lack of evidence.\nImperial Tobacco denied the charges, claiming in a statement that its dealings with the retailers were simply legitimate \"promotional arrangements\". They have said they are considering an appeal against the decision.\nIn a press release the OFT said that the fines would send out a strong message. \"Practices such as these, which restrict the ability of retailers to set their resale prices for competing brands independently, are unlawful.\" said Simon Williams, OFT Senior Director of Goods. \"They can lead to reduced competition and ultimately disadvantage consumers.\"\n\"This enforcement action will send out a strong message that such practices, which could in principle be applied to the sale of many different products, can result in substantial penalties for those who engage in them.\""}

Although South Korean officials have not said specifically that North Korea is to blame, saying only that the possibility of North Korean involvement is being investigated, analysts and the media in South Korea have been speculating on a possible retaliation from South Korea, although a military response is not expected.\nEarlier this week, the stern section of the ship was recovered from the site of the sinking, and investigators from several countries are examining the wreckage in an effort to determine the cause. Yesterday, a lead investigator said that \"It was highly likely that it was an external, rather than internal, explosion\" that caused the ship to sink.\nThe controversy surrounding the sinking of the ship is likely to reflect poorly on the South Korean government, which has already been criticized as mounting a slow response to the wreck.  Before the incident, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had reportedly been trying to arrange a meeting between officials from the two Koreas, and if signs of North Korean involvement become evident, it could undermine Lee's credibility in South Korea, as he would likely be seen as having left holes in South Korea's defense."}

Roberts argued the point in his written statement on the ruling, saying that \"The First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter or its content.\"  According to Roberts, the law had been too broad, and the court was therefore unwilling to place it outside the protection of the First Amendment.\nReactions to the ruling were mixed.

In addition to allowing more Chicago residents to become legislators, this method severely weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs. Republicans, if given the chance to draw the maps, could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican-leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts.\nThe Fair Map Amendment, supported by Republicans and good-government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois, would take the redistricting process out of legislators' hands and instead give that task to an independent, nine-member commission.

Legislators also have considered other ways to reform the redistricting process. A few Republican party leaders' campaign funds have donated cash to the group organizing the petition, and House Minority Leader Tom Cross has asked the governor to call a special session on legislative redistricting.

The bill will enter into effect in mid-August of this year, 90 days after the current state legislative session ends.\nThe bill has been widely criticized both within Arizona and across the country. The most prominent criticism has come from President Obama, who said that the bill will \"threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.\"  The clause allowing police to demand documents was compared to Nazism by the Catholic cardinal in Los Angeles.\nThe law is expected to face several court challenges as soon as it enters into effect, and President Obama has already ordered the US Justice Department to determine the legality of the bill.\nSpeaking in support of the bill, Governor Brewer said that the law would represent \"another tool for our state to use as we work to solve a crisis we did not create and the federal government has refused to fix.\"  She said that she agreed with sponsors of the bill, who said that it would be an important asset in the fight against illegal immigration, particularly as Arizona is a major crossing point on the US-Mexico border.

He was a non-commissioned Nazi officer, who moved to Chile after the Second World War, evading accusations of sexual abuse of minors. He established an organization in a rural area of Chile, in favour of the poor people, located 400 kilometers south of Santiago, to the border of Argentina. He named this place Villa Babiera.\nHe began his rule of this area in 1961; he established a private tyrannical regime, where almost 300 Germans worked for decades without pay. Men and women were segregated, and people who tried to escape were killed. Adults and children considered it an \"honour\" for Schfer to chose to have sex with them.\nWhen Pinochet's regime ended, Schfer escaped from Chile in 1996 to avoid being imprisoned, after he came under investigation for human rights violations and abuse to minors. He was detained in Argentina, and then extradited back to Chile in 2005. Since then he was imprisoned.

We need to end collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and government employee unions. No elected or appointed official should ever get a pension or post-employment benefits.\nThe friendly business and low tax environment in California will attract tens of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs to California and, eventually, tax receipts will soar. However, any excess revenue should be used to retire debt or returned to the taxpayers.\n((MM)) What is your stance on gay marriage?\n((DO)) Why not just get government out of peoples personal lives? Let people choose how to live their lives, choose with whom they share it, and decide for themselves what arrangements (marriage or otherwise) should be made for all of lifes situations. Treat every individual equally. Do not discriminate in favor of or against married couples (or groups). Let them decide what promises to make to one another and embed those promises in contracts. The state can then enforce the contracts, as it should enforce all contracts between consenting adults. If religions want to put their stamp of approval on a wedding, let them; let the people involved decide what to do.\n((MM)) Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana and why?\n((DO)) Yes. I believe in the legalization of marijuana. The government does not have either the right nor the moral authority to prohibit what substances people put into their bodies for either medicinal or recreational or other purposes. Practically, the war on drugs has been a dismal failure. Just like prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, prostitution, etc., they do not work. They push the activity underground and create opportunities for the criminal element and, likewise, opportunities for the corruption of police and other public officials. Generally, such laws are enforced inconsistently and to the detriment of the most vulnerable individuals in society.\n((MM)) Explain how you think California's immigration laws should work.\n((DO)) Philosophically, I believe in open borders. People should be able to come and go as they please. However, the government should not take money from one group of individuals (taxpayers) and give it to others. We should not subsidize nor penalize immigrants. If people want to come to the United States and California to work and take care of their families, they should be allowed to do so. However, those who commit crimes against persons or property should be either imprisoned (for serious offenses) or deported. In that regard, the United States government needs to monitor and control its borders.\n((MM)) Why should California \"permanently roll-back spending to or below the level of 1998... and absolutely limit future spending increases?\" \n((DO)) Over the past 20-30 years, the state of California has continuously increased the share of the economy that it confiscates through taxes and spends, mostly, on unionized government employees and social welfare. It has reduced the amount of money that benefits the general populace in infrastructure. I chose 1998 because that pre-dates the pension scam perpetrated by Gray Davis, the Democrats in the state legislature, and the government employee unions, in which retirement ages were reduced to absurd levels and benefits were increased by about 50%. Were we to roll back spending to 1998 levels, we could both eliminate the state income tax and have a budget surplus. In my opinion, that process was a fraud perpetrated on the taxpayers of California and should be prosecuted criminally. The politicians took bribes in the form of campaign contributions and support and the leaders of the government employee unions paid bribes.\n((MM)) Why is it necessary to repeal the global warming laws?\n((DO)) There is no global warming crisis. The alleged warming trends do not exist and there has actually been a cooling trend over the last ten or so years. The \"scientists\" who raise the alarm on global warming trends have been discredited as having manipulated their data and destroying data that does not support their beliefs (if they even believe them). Billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been diverted to politically correct scientists and scammers like Al Gore who have gotten rich from this falsehood and who propose to use global warming as an excuse to control mankind's behavior (their real intent). Even if there is some minor global warming (which there has been in some earlier periods in history), there is no reason to believe that it would be harmful to the climate as a whole. Some areas may benefit and some may lose, but that would be true if we had global cooling, too. As an intellectual exercise, ask yourself these questions (originally posed by Vaclav Klaus)\nEven if we can say yes, with some degree of probability, to the first question, the answers to the remaining questions clearly is no.\n((MM)) Why should the state remove itself from the education of children? Would you also cut funds for the University of California?\n((DO)) Like everything the government does, it does a miserable job of educating children and spends way too much doing so. Private competitive schools, perhaps funded by vouchers, would be better. Public school systems have way too many administrators and lack accountability. Teacher unions have the same adverse effect on education that government employee unions have on other government \"services.\" Let's give parents choices by eliminating the monopolistic, union-controlled schools. Competition works and freedom works.\nAs far as the UC [University of California] system, it is a massive overfunded boondoggle. Higher education has been protected from price competition for many decades. The more government subsidizes education, the higher the price charged for that education with the result that the students and their parents end up paying as much as before. The cost of education has increased far faster than inflation over the past several decades. From what I've seen and read, most university professors are grossly underworked. They need to spend more time teaching; there needs to be more innovation in teaching to keep the cost down (like online education, but certainly not limited to that). Many of the services provided to students at our universities are more baby-sitting than education. We need real competition in education and we need to privatize our public universities. Let people keep their tax money and use it to decide where to go to school. I propose we sell the UC system to private owners and let it compete."}

The efforts began yesterday, although it could be as late as tomorrow before they are completed. The vehicles will attempt to engage a device called a blowout preventer, which can seal the well shut to prevent sudden releases of pressure within the well, like the one that may have caused the rig to explode. According to BP, the company that operated the well, the attempt was the first of its kind in the world.\nThe leaks are on a pipe from the ocean floor called a riser. They are currently estimated to be releasing around 42,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and the oil slick on the surface of the ocean is estimated to cover an area about 48 by 39 miles at its widest points. Officials say oil is not expected to reach land until at least Thursday, and would remain at least 30 miles from land through Tuesday. The impact of the spill on wildlife is currently unknown; there have been no reports of animal casualties, though whales were seen in the vicinity of the spill yesterday.\nAccording to officials, there are two other possible ways to contain the oil spill if the attempt to seal the well is unsuccessful. One option would be to install a large dome over the leak and send the collected oil to the surface, where it would be collected by ships. This has been done before, although only in shallow water. The second option is to drill an entirely new well that would intersect the original, although this could take months to complete."}

Hitchcock was an English filmmaker and producer, who produced several films in a career of sixty years.\nHitchcock was born in Leytonstone, London, United Kingdom on August 13, 1899. He described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered, a situation aggravated by his obesity. His father died when he was 14. After he graduated, he became intrigued by photography and started working in film production in London on a branch of what would become Paramount Pictures. After a successful career with silent movies and the early talkie ones in the United Kingdom, in March 1939, David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock onto a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939 as the Hitchcock family was moving to Hollywood, United States. He was nominated for five Academy Awards as a best director but never took home the prize, and one of his most succesful movies during his Hollywood stay was the 1958 film Vertigo, featuring James Stewart and Kim Novak. Hitchcock became a United States citizen in 1956 while retaining his British citizenship.\nHitchcock's last successful production was the 1972 film Frenzy. The 1976 film Family Plot was his last film. Hitchcock died from kidney failure in his home at Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, at 80. His body was cremated and his ashes were thrown in the Pacific Ocean."}

Unconfirmed reports say an unknown man ran away from the car. A roughly square area of the city, its boundaries formed by 43rd and 48th Street and 7th and 8th Avenue, was evacuated.\nThe New York Police Department bomb squad was called in and were able to retrieve the package using a robot. Officials removed gunpowder, consumer-grade fireworks, two five-gallon cans of gasoline, three propane tanks, electrical wiring, and two clocks with batteries that apparently were fashioned as one or two detonators. The bomb has been described as \"amateurish\". No casualties or injuries were reported.\nAs of yet police have not named a suspect and are reviewing security footage.

The Coast Guard said it was planning to conduct a flyover of the slick to determine its extent sometime on Friday. According to the National Weather Service, strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted to continue through the weekend, hindering cleanup efforts.\nAlso early on Friday morning, a senior government official, White House advisor David Axelrod, said that the government was immediately banning all new offshore drilling until the investigation into the spill had been completed.  His announcement came just after a month the administration relaxed restrictions of offshore drilling. \nThe operation to clean up the spill has accelerated in recent days, with the US Navy having joined the effort, as well as resources from the Coast Guard and British Petroleum (BP), the lessor of the rig at the time of the explosion.  The total assets deployed in the operation are estimated to be around 1,900 people and more than 300 ships and aircraft.  Additionally, six remotely operated submarines are trying to stem the leaks, which now number three, at the ocean's floor.\nOn Wednesday, the estimated amount of oil spilling from the damaged well was raised to 5,000 barrels, or around 210,000 gallons, a day, five times the original estimate of 1,000 barrels a day.  This figure was later revised upwards again to 25,000 barrels (1.05 million gallons) per day. So far, the cleanup operation has laid around 210,000 feet of containment booms to protect vulnerable wildlife refuges on the Gulf Coast, and an additional 66,000 feet of boom has been provided by the US Navy.  Since the beginning of the operation, more than 18,000 gallons of an oil/water mix have been recovered from the ocean, and after a successful test burn of oil, plans are being made to scale the burns up.  According to a BP official, \"We believe we can now scale that up and burn between 500 and 1,000 barrels at a time.\" The first test burned around 100 barrels of oil.\nDespite the efforts, many are still worried about the potential consequences of the spill, and officials said that the damage could end up being more than that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. One analyst said that he expected \"that movement is going to continue to stress and fatigue the pipe and create more leaks,\" adding that \"this is not on a good trajectory.\"\nBP has developed two options to stop the flow of oil at the source, but both are expected to take at least weeks to complete. The first option is to lower large structures over the leak, which would allow the oil to be safely transported to the surface. BP is building one such structure, but it isn't expected to be completed for at least several weeks.  The second option is to drill a second well which would then plug the leak at the source. A well for this purpose will begin to be drilled within two days, although it could be up to three months before the leak is completely plugged."}

The party is a member of Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA).\nTzomakas also sits on his local 5th Athens Municipal District committee, which is a joint effort by left-wing parties including SYRIZA, the Anticapitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow and a number of other political parties to oppose austerity measures proposed by the government. All left-wing parties in the country except the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) are involved. Tzomakas explained that the KKE prefers not to co-operate with other radical left-wing groups.\nThe interview comes amid tensions in cash-strapped Greece, where the government is introducing controversial austerity measures to try to ease the nation's debt-problem. An international rescue package has been prepared by European Union member states and the International Monetary Fund  should Greece require a bailout; protests have been held against government attempts to manage the economic situation.\n((Iain Macdonald))  How are you doing today?\n((Petros Tzomakas)) We are coping; were looking at numbers and digits and how they're tearing us apart.\n((IM)) Has slavish pursuit of free-market capitalism been the cause of Europe, and particularly Greece's, economic woes? How, given the Soviet collapse, and China being communist in name only, would your vision of a communist system have been better for the majority of citizens?\n((PT)) Given current circumstances I think the main goal should be to nationalise means of production and services such as banks but under democratic control by unions and local councils where it effects local economies and re-elect local representatives where needed.\nThere is a necessity for a planned economy but one controlled not by bureaucracy but by the people participating in it.\n((IM))  For right or for wrong, we have now reached a situation where Greece is on the brink of an international bailout. If you were given power tomorrow, what steps would you take immediately to get Greece back on track?\n((PT)) We would immediately nationalise the  banks. We would refuse to pay the bonds which were called upon during this time, renationalise privatised industries and invest in such a planned economy.\nBasically, we would refuse to pay debts created by the banks on our government.\n((IM))  Picking up on your comments about defense expenditure: Is that expenditure a result of a perceived threat from Turkey, and if so, is this really an issue or a creation of a problem where there isnt one?\n((PT)) There has always been tension between the governments of Greece and Turkey, some created by attempts to cover mistakes by both sides. It is no coincidence that both are in dire straits financially.\nIt is an artificial thing created by [the] government[s]. Of course these things can escalate; both Greece and Turkey have a policy of arms buildup. We recently had the sledgehammer controversy in Turkey where they planned to create incidents within Greece in an effort to seize power.\nAlso, many high-ranking army officers have been prosecuted in Turkey for trying to seize power in a coup.\n((IM))  Why do you oppose the current austerity measures? What has the government, in your view, got so wrong?\n((PT)) The government, in its effort to pay back banks and in fact to pay back interest on loans, has already paid in some cases twice the original loan at high interest rates.\nThey're trying to grab as much money as they can and we know for a fact thats also on the orders of the Greek capitalist class.\nThey are reducing the workers rights for more money and this actually leads to poverty. Greece will be in guaranteed recession for two years and hopes then to create a 0.1% GDP rise. That will be very hard.\nWe know from a variety of statistics that the working class will be made to pay around 35% of the current GDP.\nConsuming will go to standstill so that in two years time debt will rise from 120% of current GDP to 150% GDP and people will suffer. We know all the loans, just like the previous loans, will be siphoned off by business and will not go into Greek coffers. It will go instead to lining the pockets of big business.\n((IM))  I have heard that people in Greece are upset that the euro has weakened Greeces economic position, as the Drachmas low value actually encouraged spending by foreigners. What steps would a socialist government take to encourage new spending in Greece by both foreign tourists and investors?\n((PT)) A socialist government could actually work if other economies and other people would follow Greeces steps. Greece would then be a self-sufficient economy and not need these investments. Of course we once had these investments, through the tourism industry, and they didnt work.\nThis is whether with the new currency of the euro or the old. The government is seriously thinking of relapse right now which would be a disaster because it would be so devalued. It would possibly even go into a tailspin of devaluation.\nThe possibilities are grossly underestimated in Greece and not enough investments are made in these possibilities.\nTourism is the main industry in Greece because there is little cost needed in investments, and it doesnt need a very big infrastructure.\nAny infrastructure that was needed has been left to abandonment by both [the last two] governments, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement and New Democracy. A visitor can see and understand this by the shape ships and ferries are in and the way facilities are lacking.\n((IM))  How do you respond to the assertion that 'democracy is the least-worst of all the political systems tried'? Would the Greek communists accept a multi-party system where some parties would be stridently advocating free-market economics?\n((PT)) One of the difficulties people face when seeking answers about a better political system is the black-and-white approach of ideas and names. True, democracy is a necessary principle, but there are vast differences between e.g. a bourgeoise democracy and a socialist democracy...\nAlso especially in Greece, the term \"communist\" is used by many in the left, it's almost a synonym. The majority of the left would strongly disagree with a one-party model. The Stalinist leaderships - what erroneously most people call \"communists\" - would probably desire such a system, but no-one would advocate such a demand today. The only political forces that everyone in the left agrees should be banned are those of the ultra-right, with racist and fascist agendas, and this because they stand against the principles of democracy in any case... As we can see however throughout Europe and in history the capitalist system needs such \"allies\" especially in times of crisis. In Greece for instance the ultra-right populist La.O.S [Popular Orthodox Rally] party has proven itself an invaluable ally of PaSoK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] in supporting the most vicious anti-labour measures, suppression of workers' rights, even a \"no-questions-asked\" policy of currency depositing that would favor money-laundering for illegal trades such as narcotics or human trafficking. In the mean time it tries to put the blame for the crisis caused by the financial system on scapegoats such as the immigrant and refugee populations.\nIf people had a fair and unbiased view of what a planned economy under democratic control could offer I believe that free-market advocates would be marginalized by the working class internationally, with no call for suppression which can lead to dangerous paths!\n((IM))  You mentioned in your email to me that the KKE does not co-operate with the rest of the nations left-wing community. Why is this? Does this split confuse potential voters about who to support?\n((PT)) Unfortunately the un-democratic Stalinist traditions and practices of the KKE are deeply-rooted in the Greek CP [Communist party] - one has only to read the analysis of their last congress to see this. Therefore the KKE cannot stand in coalitions as an equal to other opinions. The current leadership of the KKE not only refuses to collaborate with the rest of the left but treats it as a class enemy, on the pretext that Synaspismos (the largest faction in the SYRIZA coalition) voted for the \"Maastricht Treaty\". This became more obvious during the December 2008 uprising where it denounced the youth as \"agent provocateurs that seak to destabilize the country manipulating the masses to violence\" and that SyRizA was \"harboring vandals and criminal elements\", earning shameful congratulations from the government and the far-right. Also the KKE through its union front P.A.ME. refuses to collaborate with other unions in industrial action except general strikes, and then always with separate demonstrations and rallies. This behaviour however has not gone unnoticed by the rank-and-file members, and there is sizable discontent with this hardline approach. The only thing that holds them is traditional strict party discipline and the occasional weaknesses of SyRIzA in terms of less militant, and more reformist positions projected by Synaspismos. In both cases, we expect to see developments that will answer to the indeed-confused public that does not give mass support to the left mostly because of disappointment over sectarianism, lack of militancy and larger demands rather than disagreement on principles."}

In general, I direct and oversee the activities of the USPP. At the moment, my most challenging task is to cultivate state parties across the US. Without them, the national party is essentially insolvent. \n((PC)) What is the Pirate Party?\n((BP)) The United States Pirate Party is a relatively new party in the U.S., currently undergoing a revival after having been founded a few years ago. We are similar in nature to the various Pirate Parties found internationally, though we differ somewhat in platform and formation.\n((PC)) What are the goals of the Pirate Party?\n((BP)) We are dedicated to protecting Americans' rights to privacy, freedom of information, reforming the patent and copyright systems, and ensuring government transparency. \n((PC)) What are some things you personally want to change about the government?\n((BP)) There are a great many things I could bring up in regards to changing in the government, so I'll keep it to my three greatest concerns: Transparency, privacy, and ballot reform. Firstly, transparency is required from our government in all but the most dire situations. President Obama seemed, at first, to be promising in this regard, but again and again since he took office, he has proven that hope to be ill-placed. ACTA is hidden from FOIA requests, more light is not shed about torture techniques, and numerous bills, most memorably the recent health care reform, are not brought to light for the promised number of days--how is this transparency? \nMy second qualm, privacy, is boiled down very simply--as technology grows, so does the ability to invade the privacy of citizens for the sake of a potential safeguard. This route is far from affective [sic] in its proposed function. We should take the time to find more effective ways to reduce crime without invading the privacy of law-abiding citizens. Not doing so is to treat each and every American as a criminal without a trial.\nAnd, thirdly, ballot access. While not necessarily a plank of our platform, it is a challenge that the USPP will have to face early on. There is a long standing idea that the United States has two political parties, and that's it, end of story. I can't help but wonder of these people--do you think that the country was founded between these two parties alone? We are a nation of many people, with many ideas and many opinions. To try and simply this to a black and white dichotomy does a disservice to the nation and its people. There are shades of gray.\n((PC)) How did you get involved with the party?\n((BP)) I got involved last fall after hearing of the success of our European counterparts in their elections. I was certain that someone had started a Pirate Party in the U.S., but was surprised that I hadn't heard about it already, so I went looking. And here I am.\n((PC)) Do you think you have a chance against other parties?\n((BP)) I have no disillusions about it being difficult, but I am convinced that we have the capability to do so, yes. Furthermore, I welcome the challenge. \n((PC)) If you could change anything right this second about the government what would it be?\n((BP)) I think if I had the opportunity to change anything, it would be one of the three that I covered in question 4. I'm inclined to say ballot access, considering the immediate impact it would have for the USPP and other smaller parties, but transparency and privacy would be close contenders. \n((PC)) Could you take this test, and let us know where you stand on the political spectrum?\n((BP)) After taking the test, I got a 60%/40%, which put me just inside the zone for a \"Centrist\". Sounds about right. \n((PC)) Anything else you want to add?\n((BP)) Just today we launched a new website, as part of our effort to restart the movement in the United States, so I invite all who read this to waltz on over to our website and take a look.

{"id": 724, "ended": true, "text": "The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has completed its investigation into the ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 into New York's Hudson River. The fifteen-month probe began after the Airbus A320 performed a water landing when bird strikes damaged both engines in a move dubbed the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" by the media. Nobody was killed.\nThe NTSB's final report, adopted after a board meeting today, concluded that a combination of safety equipment better than the mandatory minimums and good reactions by the crew were the main reasons the 150 passengers and five crew survived. The board stated that the aircraft's equipment met the standards required for \"extended overwater operations\", equipment that was not needed for the January 2009 flight. \nThe aircraft was equiped with escape slides that doubled as water rafts at the front and aft emergency exits, but the aft ones were rendered unavailable. Airbus assumed when designing the aircraft that only one engine would be inoperative during an emergency ditching, and current emergency checklists assume plenty of prior warning for dual-engine failure since the aircraft would be at a high altitude. The A320 was at just 2,700 feet when the incident occurred, having just taken off when it collided with a flock of Canada geese, almost completely removing the engines' ability to generate thrust.\nThe final report has blamed a number of factors for extensive fuselage damage caused in the impact, which cracked a rear bulkhead and caused the aircraft to flood, as well as taking the rear slides out of action. The board said standards aircraft should meet in ditchings  set by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA)  were inadequate, training in industry was not sufficient for ditchings and the high level of tasks the crew had to focus on made it difficult for the pilot to maintain his airspeed. The pilot's decision to ditch was credited as being the best possible solution to the emergency.\nThe NTSB noted that while the rear rafts failed, 64 people climbed into the forward rafts, and said many of these people would have been immersed in the frigid river. The board claimed that this could induce \"cold shock\", which can lead to drowning within minutes.\nThe report found that the good visibility, calm water, nearby ferries which provided rescues within twenty minutes and good cockpit resource management, allowing the crew to maintain control, were further factors that contributed to the survival of those on board. However, it also found that \"more creative and effective methods of conveying safety information to passengers\" are required after learning that most passengers had not paid attention to the in-flight safety announcement. It also noted that many passengers had difficulty putting on the life vests supplied under the seats.\nThe report further stated that the accident was hard to predict due to the fact that bird strikes tend to occur much lower, usually below 500 feet. It considered the possibilities of fitting engine screens or redesigning engines to mitigate bird strike risk, but these proposals were rejected after consideration since they were deemed unfeasable. \nNTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman described the circumstances as \"a great example of the professionalism of the crewmembers, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who all played a role in preserving the safety of everyone aboard.\" She further discussed the safety recommendations the report will contain when it is released. \"I believe the safety recommendations that have come out of this investigation have an extraordinary origin - a very serious accident in which everyone survived. Even in an accident where everyone survives, there are lessons learned and areas that could use improvement.  Our report today takes these lessons learned so that, if our recommendations are implemented, every passenger and crewmember may have the opportunity to benefit from the advances in safety.\" A total of 35 recommendations have been made seeking improved checklists for emergencies, better certification standards for aircraft and their engines, advances in crew training, better safety equipment and improved safety briefings to passengers.\nOne result of these findings is that the board will likely ask the FAA to require emergency equipment for water landings on all commercial aircraft.

The possession of nuclear bombs is not a source of pride. Its possession is disgusting and shameful.\"\nUS White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that it was \"predictable\" that Iran was continuing its silence on the treaty itself, which would see all signatories relinquish any access to nuclear weapons, through either disarmament or a pledge not to develop nuclear weapons.

This merger will allow Continental and United to surpass the recent Delta and Northwest merger, becoming the largest airline in the world when the merger is finalized.\nThe two airlines failed to reach an agreement on a separate merger several years ago when Continental dropped out of the talks.

This led United to begin merger talks with alliance partner US Airways, which also failed to come to fruition.\nFile:N775UA.jpg\nThe stock price of both companies rose when news of their merger was announced. Unlike most mergers, this one is relatively even in terms of what each company receives as a result. United Airlines is taking 55% control of the combined company and keeping its name, as well as becoming the main base for the group in Chicago. Continentals Chief Executive Officer will become the CEO of the combined company, known as United Continental Holdings Inc, and will gain control of the other 45% of the new airline. \nSince base operations are moving to Chicago, the city of Houston recently submitted proposals arguing for not cutting Continentals over 1,000 jobs in Texas.

{"id": 754, "ended": true, "text": "A day after general elections were held in the UK, results indicate there will be a hung parliament  where no party obtains the simple majority needed to pass legislation on its own  raising the prospect of a minority or coalition government being formed, which would require cooperation between parties.\nWith only one constituency not yet counted, David Cameron's Conservatives have taken 306 seats, incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party 258 seats, and Nick Clegg with his Liberal Democrats with 57. Cameron has said he will negotiate with the latter party to try and form a coalition to attain more than 325 seats, or half those in the parliament.\nAfter Labour's large losses at the polls yesterday, both in terms of seats and votes, Cameron said Brown has \"lost his mandate to govern\". Clegg, meanwhile, says he thinks the result allows the Conservatives to try to form a government first, contrary to past tradition, under which the incumbent prime minister and his party in a hung parliament try first to form a coalition.\n\"I've said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern either on its own or by reaching out to other parties, and I stick to that view,\" Clegg said this morning.\n\"It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute majority. That is why I think it is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.\"\nClegg described his party's performance as \"disappointing\" during the night, as they had failed to make any significant advances in their target seats. Overall, the general swing varied, with all parties failing to gain many of their targets, and suffering unexpected losses in others.\nPre-empting a statement from Cameron, Brown said at lunchtime in a short statement outside Downing Street that if any negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats failed, he would be prepared to form an alliance with Nick Clegg, offering \"far-reaching political reform\", in reference to the Liberals' long held position that the UK's first past the post voting system must be reformed into some form of proportional representation system, historically opposed by the Conservatives.\n\"I understand and completely respect the position of Mr. Clegg in stating that he wishes first to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party,\" he commented, but noting that, \"should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing [...] I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties.\" He said there is \"substantial common ground\" between his party and the Liberals.\n\"I understand as I know my fellow party leaders do that people do not like the uncertainty or want it to be prolonged. We live, however, in a parliamentary democracy, the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good,\" Brown said.\nCameron made his position known in a statement delivered in the early afternoon, in which he offered the prospect of both a Lib Dem supported minority Conservative government, or an alliance \"stronger, more stable, more collaborative government than that\". Cameron stated: \"I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems  the debt crisis, our deep social problems, and our broken political system.\"\nHe went on to describe how both parties had \"common ground\" they could work together on to form a government in the \"national interest\". On the issue of electoral reform, Cameron ruled out holding a referendum, but suggested forming an all party commission on electoral and voting reform. He also ruled out concessions on other Lib Dem positions like greater integration with the European Union or altering the position on defence and the nuclear deterrent, although offering to adopt other Lib Dem policies, such as on schools.\nThe AFP news agency says this is the first time the Liberal Democrats have considered working with Conservatives; previously, the former were thought likelier to negotiate with Labour due to them being considered more \"progressive\". \nBrown, however, has made it clear he has no intention of stepping down as PM, saying he has \"a duty as Prime Minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government\".\nBusiness Secretary Lord Mandelson commented on the matter, saying: \"The Prime Minister's duty is to stay at his post, to continue doing his job and not resign until it is clear who the Queen should call as an alternative to form a new government, should Mr Brown not be able to do so.\"\nWhen asked whether it was \"inconceivable\" that the PM should step down, Mandelson responded: \"Frankly, there are quite a number of permutations. And the reason I don't want to start getting into hypotheses about what may or may not happen is because, quite frankly, I think it's premature. I am not ruling out or ruling in anything.\"\nUnder British parliamentary convention, in the event of a hung parliament, Brown remains Prime Minister and the Labour Government continues to operate until it is demonstrated it cannot command a majority. The Government effectively gave approval for talks to begin by giving civil servants permission to support all parties in hung parliament negotiations. Brown described how the negotiations could be \"prolonged\", and while recognising people might want a swift conclusion, \"the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good\"."}

The teams fought out a 00 draw at Rugby Park,  a game which did not see many shots on goal with only nine in the whole game.  It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.\nKilmarnock had previously been two points clear of twelfth position, occupied instead by Falkirk.  The team in last place would be relegated, and, only needing a draw, Kilmarnock played a slow and defensive game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005. With only two shots on target the entire game, much of the credit for the draw went to each team's defensive line, putting in several last-ditch tackles to stifle attacks.\nWhile Falkirk had the upper hand in the first half possession-wise, the contest was more even in the second.  On 77 minutes, the Falkirk side had the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a clear foul on the Kilmarnock goalkeeper.  Shortly after, Kilmarnock clipped the crossbar with a Craig Bryson effort.  Falkirk had a glorious opportunity to win the game on 86 minutes, when the ball landed for Ryan Flynn with the goal empty, but the young midfielder put it over from ten yards.\nKilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood, speaking after the game, spoke of his experiences: \"It was a long, long day. I wouldn't advise it for anybody to be honest, you know. It's the first time and hopefully the last time.\n\"They didn't really cause us any problems.

I wouldn't want to stay with too many games like this.\"\nThe manager of Falkirk, Steven Pressley, also told Radio Scotland his views on the game: \"It was a very emotional day, you know, we're bitterly disappointed, but once again I couldn't ask any more from this group of players. The things we talk about, the desire, the effort, the application, they were in abundance today. They gave me their absolute lot.

Seven minutes later, experienced winger Ryan Giggs slotted past the goalkeeper from a low Berbatov through ball. Just before half time, Ricardo Fuller forced a reflex save from van der Sar.\nIn the second half, a Higginbotham own goal gave Manchester United their third goal of the afternoon after a cross from striker Wanye Rooney. Several shots were saved from either side, before Park made it four with a close-range header with six minutes to go.\nAfterwards, Sir Alex Ferguson spoke of his disappointment: \"When we heard Wigan was down to 10 men, our hopes evaporated then.

Senator Reid called her \"the right choice to replace Justice Stevens on the Supreme Court\", while McConnell hoped \"that the Obama administration doesn't think the ideal Supreme Court nominee is someone who would rubber-stamp its policies.\"\nIt is currently unclear what the meetings mean for Kagan: Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) guessed that around half of the Senate's 100 members already have strong opinions about the nominee.

Kagan's background is also of concern to some. If confirmed, she would be the first US Supreme Court Justice without ever having held a judicial position in 38 years.

She was previously nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C.

{"id": 780, "ended": true, "text": "Wikinews reporter Iain Macdonald has performed an interview with Dr Isabella Margara, a London-based member of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). In the interview Margara sets out the communist response to current events in Greece as well as discussing the viability of a communist economy for the nation. She also hit back at Petros Tzomakas, a member of another Greek far-left party which criticised KKE in a previous interview.\nThe interview comes amid tensions in cash-strapped Greece, where the government is introducing controversial austerity measures to try to ease the nation's debt-problem. An international rescue package has been prepared by European Union member states and the International Monetary Fund  should Greece require a bailout; protests have been held against government attempts to manage the economic situation.\n((Iain Macdonald))  Has slavish pursuit of free-market capitalism been the cause of Europe, and particularly Greece's, economic woes?\n((Dr Isabella Margara)) What we are experiencing today  not only in Greece, but in all capitalist countries  is a crisis of overproduction. The exploitation of the working class and the other popular strata is intensified due to the fact that the bourgeoisie has been keeping for itself larger and larger parts of the produced wealth. Behind overproduction lies the over-accumulation of capital. The average profit rate is decreased in the main sectors of the economy.  This leads to destruction of part of productive forces, closing factories, inflation, mass redundancies of superfluous workers as waste  in order to permit a new process of accumulation to begin, when new sectors of the economy will secure the increase of the average profit rate. This has nothing to do with the management of the system by social democrats or liberals; it is an inevitable outcome of capitalism.\nThe national deficits do exist. In fact, behind the debt are the huge tax reliefs for large monopolies, the massive bank bailouts, the inconceivable NATO military expenses, the subsidies in the name of capitalist development. In Greece at the moment, there is a clear expression of the imperialist rivalries between the US and EU, between EU countries and especially between Germany and France. However, it is now becoming clearer every day that the ruling class is using the existing deficits, in Greece and in Europe, in order to promote new anti-labour policies which will secure the profits of the capital. These measures have been pre-decided a long time ago in the Maastricht Treaty and are here to stay. Their aim is not just to exit the crisis, but to ensure stability and high profits for the capital in the next phases of the economic cycle.\n\n((Iain))  How, given the Soviet collapse, and China being communist in name only, would your vision of a communist system have been better for the majority of citizens?\n((Isabella)) Despite the various problems of socialist countries, the socialist system of the 20th century proved the superiority of socialism over capitalism and the huge advantages that it provides for peoples lives and working conditions. The Soviet Union and the world socialist system constituted the only real counterweight to imperialist aggression  we recently celebrated the 65th anniversary of the Anti-fascist victory. The achievements of workers in the socialist states were a point of reference for many decades and contributed to the gains won by the working class in capitalist societies as well. In this way, everyone had guaranteed work, public free health care and education, housing, and access to intellectual and cultural creativity. The complete eradication of the terrible legacy of illiteracy, in combination with the increase in the general level of education and specialization and the abolition of unemployment, constitute unique achievements of socialism. In the Soviet Union in 1975 it was guaranteed by law that the hours of work could not surpass 41 per week, among the lowest in the world. All workers were guaranteed days for rest and relaxation and annual paid holidays. Non-working time was extended and its content was changed. It was transformed into time for the development of the cultural and educational level of the workers, for the enhancement of their participation in workers power and in the control of the administration of productive units. Social Security for working people was of utmost priority for the socialist state. A comprehensive system of retirement benefits, with the important achievement of low age limits for retirement (55 years for women, 60 for men), was created. Socialist power laid the foundation for the abolition of inequality of women, overcoming the great difficulties that objectively existed. Socialism ensured in practice the social character of motherhood and socialized childcare. It instituted equal rights for women and men in the economic, political and cultural realm, although not all forms of unequal relations between the two genders, which had become entrenched over a long period of time, had been successfully eradicated.\nOur critical approach regarding various issues of building socialism in the USSR, namely decisions in the economy in critical times, or the extend of workers control and participation, do not change the fact that the first historical attempt to abolish the exploitation of man by man had many achievements for the majority of people and many of the rights that Soviet people had in 1975 seem like a dream for us today. Also, it does not change the fact that the contradictions of the capitalist way of production become deeper. The counter-revolution may have won one fight, but it has not won the war. As long as there is socialised production combined with capitalist property of the means of production, there will be crisis, unemployment and poverty  and socialism will remain the only way out.\nOur Party in 2009 held its 18th Congress, during which we discussed and studied socialism and the causes of counter-revolution in the USSR. The conclusions we drew have been published and we have enriched our programme based on them. See here for more information.\n((Iain))  For right or for wrong, we have now reached a situation where Greece is on the brink of an international bailout. If you were given power tomorrow, what steps would you take immediately to get Greece back on track?\n((Isabella)) At the moment we are trying to build a front of workers, small farmers, the self-employed and working young people. This front needs to become a huge social and political anti-imperialist anti-monopoly coalition with only one duty - to bring the working class into power and socialise the basic means of production, namely energy, telecommunications, mines, manufacturing, and transportation.  We would implement public and free education, health and national insurance systems. Next to the socialised sectors, there can be the co-operatives of small farmers and small tradesmen in sectors of the economy where concentration is still low. The production and distribution in both the socialised and the co-operative sectors will be under workers control as part of a centrally planned economy. This is a vital need in order to fulfil our contemporary needs, in order to ensure that all productive forces are mobilised, that science and technology will develop in favour of the people, and that all international economic co-operation will be used, on the basis of mutual benefit. The government, which will be the organ of the popular power, will have to ensure the participation of the people in building this new society. The debt is due to the power of monopolies. There will be no solution if the capitalist profits remain untouchable, if we dont disengage from EU and NATO, if the capitalists continue to rule at the expense of the working class.\n((Iain))  Why do you oppose the current austerity measures? What has the government, in your view, got so wrong?\n((Isabella)) Massive and drastic cuts to public and private sector salaries and pensions, further cuts of benefits, reduced overtime payments, increase of the VAT up to 23%, increase of the indirect taxes, abolishment of collective labour agreements, massive redundancies to public services and merges, right of unrestricted redundancies to private companies, and increases to the retirement age: Huge masses will be condemned to unemployment and extreme poverty. Health and Education will become a privilege only for a small minority. The recovery phase will lead to new concentration of wealth to the capital, to an increase in the degree of exploitation. The recovery, when it happens, will not have a positive impact on the people on one hand, and will lead relatively soon to a new crisis on the other. That is why we oppose the measures.\nThat is also why the working class should not be trapped in a discussion about bonds or interest rates, the simple reason being that it has nothing to gain from this discussion. The international loans will end up in the capitals pockets, not the working class. The Greeks have suffered when the rates were down, they suffer now that the rates are up. We do not intend to share the capital's 'anxiety' about the bourse, because it is becoming clearer every day that if plutocracy does not go bankrupt, then the people will.\nThe government is not doing anything wrong  in fact, it is doing a great job representing the interests of its bosses, the Greek capitalists, the imperialists of E.U., the I.M.F. But they want the working class partners to their crime. They are telling us that our sacrifice to live in poverty and work until we die is our patriotic duty. What they are not telling us is that the workers, the farmers, the owners of small shops; we do not have the same country as these E.U. fans of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, the City-educated bankers, the corporate media owners. Their country and their god is exploitation and profit. Our people have proven their patriotism in every single crucial point in history for thousands of years now. But this case is different, the working Greek man and women should not make any sacrifices for plutocracy! The only sacrifice that should be made is to fight the dangerous fear and hesitation and organise the struggle. Thats what will help our own country and our class.\n((Iain))  I have heard that people in Greece are upset that the euro has weakened Greeces economic position, as the {{w|Drachma]]'s low value actually encouraged spending by foreigners. What steps would a socialist government take to encourage new spending in Greece by both foreign tourists and investors?\n((Isabella)) As mentioned earlier, since the agreements signed within the EU do not allow for manoeuvres in favour of the people, our disengagement would be inevitable and would be an essential term in order to plan the economy based on how we will fulfil our contemporary needs. The currency itself is not the main issue.\nTourism is another sector of the economy whose fate depends again on who owns the means of production. Only with a different economy the country will develop the infrastructures and provide quality services that will first of all guarantee decent working conditions, will be accessible to all the population and will be cheap.\nSo far, the development of Greek tourism has been based on profit. Therefore, the fees for ships and other means of transport are outrageous; many islands are left with no regular connection with the mainland because these lines are not considered to be profitable. Both PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and ND [New Democracy] governments, under the EU guidance, have implemented policies that led to rough working conditions and wages in tourism. Besides, more than 60% of Greeks at the moment cannot go on any holiday and after the latest measures these numbers will increase; another significant portion reduces the time off work, and a third one relies on the hospitality of friends and family for their holidays, due to their low income.\nFor us, tourism and holidays are not a trade, they are a social right  for both the Greek workers and the tourists that will choose to visit our country. \n((Iain)) How do you respond to the assertion that 'democracy is the least-worst of all the political systems tried'? Would the Greek communists accept a multi-party system where some parties would be stridently advocating free-market economics?\n((Isabella)) Democracy is not synonymous with the number of parties that exist in a country. For example, today in Greece we have dozens of political parties but despite the fact that the vast majority of the population opposes the austerity measures, the Parties that have the majority support them. How is that democratic? Nearly all strikes in Greece over the last decade have been declared illegal by the bourgeois court. In the workplace, there is no other law but the law of the employer.\nIn the process of building an anti-imperialist anti-monopoly Front, there will be a social coalition of the small farmers, the self employed, or other poor popular strata that will follow the working class since that will be their objective interest. Besides, peoples power is the real democracy, since capitalists and monopolies do not exist: its the democracy which is guaranteed by the direct political action of millions of people  in their workplaces, in their industrial units, in their neighbourhoods, in their popular organisations.\n((Iain)) How would you respond to allegations that the recent protest from the Acropolis was not appropriate for a historic monument?\n((Isabella)) The Acropolis is more than a touristic attraction. For the Greek people, it is a symbol of hope and dignity. KKE made this symbolic demonstration in order to emphasize that the attack against the Greek working class is a preview of the attack that follows to the other European people. And that the struggle of the Greek working class is indeed at the moment a struggle that gives hope to all the peoples abroad, who suffer the same. From that point of view, our demonstration not only was not inappropriate, but actually highlighted the true meaning of the monument. And judging by the impact this symbolic occupation had, I would think it has been very successful as well!\nThose who accuse us of blasphemy are those who have been shamelessly privatising most historic and archaeological monuments in Greece during the last decades. In 1992, Coca Cola used the Acropolis for a commercial, where the monument was built on bottles instead of columns! Samsung recently filmed its own commercial, let alone the various fashion shows that take place there. They have been selling out our beaches and forests to touristic monopolies and have been offering the monuments in order to promote commercial products  and that is not considered to be inappropriate. They accuse us of undermining tourism  in fact all visitors had free entry to Acropolis on that day!\nA few days ago, being annoyed by the fact that the seamen prevented the strike breaking in a cruise ship, the bourgeoisie and its journalists accused the seamen of anti-patriotism for attacking tourism which is the only thing we have left. They even encouraged the government to ban the organisation of strikes. Despite the media efforts to turn even the tourists against the seamen, the majority of travellers expressed their solidarity to the strike. Their problem is not the historical meaning of Acropolis or tourism, their problem is organised struggle.\nWe have said it before and we'll say it again: the images broadcast by the media of our struggle are an honour for the working people of our country. \n((Iain)) How would you respond to the criticisms levelled by Petros Tzomakas of Xekinima, who denounced the KKE's lack of co-operation with SYRIZA [Coalition of the Radical Left] in a recent interview?\n((Isabella)) SYRIZA are the tail of social democracy in Greece. Their analysis on the crisis is similar to PASOK. According to them, the way out is a more human capitalism, where people will come first and profits will follow. What they are hiding from the people is that capitalist profits cannot co-exist with pro-popular policies, the basic contradiction between capital and labour cannot be overcome.\nSYRIZA, being consistently pro-E.U. (it has voted for the Maastricht treaty after all), prefers the implementation of the same measures by the E.U. rather than the IMF and fights for different versions of the 'Stability Pact'. As if the E.U. is the good cop and the IMF the bad one. We say: this is a fake dilemma; there is no good or bad imperialism. All of them are good for serving their own monopolies, their own fat cats. The bottom line is that there is increasing antagonism between the different imperialist centres and the Greek government is trying to play the game with all of them. KKE has warned that this leads to our even deeper involvement in the inter-imperialist rivalries, and this can be a very dangerous path. They all agree 100% on the measures taken by the government and they ask for more blood now. Contrary to the party of Syriza, we do not plan to choose our assassin or negotiate the terms of the assassination with any of them.\nIt is also important to notice that for years now, in the trade union movement and during the latest strikes and rallies, SYRIZA has been following the compromised leaderships of GSEE [General Confederation of Greek Workers] and ADEDY (the Greek TUC in the private and public sector respectively, controlled by PASOK) who originally boycotted the strikes, went on strike breaking and then dragged them in unwillingly under public pressure, in order to minimise the damage to the government. \n((Iain)) I notice that the KKE is seeking to distance itself from the recent deaths in Athens. Are the people responsible completely wrong in their actions, or can you sympathise with their anger? Do you believe they should be prosecuted?\n((Isabella)) The burning of the bank at Stadiou Avenue by anarchist provocation groups, which led to the death of three people, is clearly a crime and a provocation aiming at the intimidation of the people and the defamation of the struggle. It proves that the mechanisms of this system are ruthless when it comes to attacking the popular movement. Both the Greek as well as the international movement have had similar experiences in the past. Do you remember the bomb at Chicagos Heymarket after the demo for the 8-hour workday in 1886, for which the pioneers of that movement were sentenced to death? Or the arson of the German parliament by the fascists, which allowed them to unleash the chase against the communists? Even the large scale provocations of today that are used in order to justify the preventive wars...\nThe question we urge people to ask themselves in order to understand why this happened is: who benefited from these actions? Clearly, it was the supporters of the anti-popular measures, all those who are scared by the huge numbers of working people who participated in the protests: the capitalists. Since they are the ones who are really responsible for the deaths, we have no illusions that they are going to be prosecuted. The main thing is that the Greek workers have got enough experience now and can differentiate between massive, organised and protected political struggle and isolated, criminal provocations that cause innocent victims, intimidate the people and at the end of the day, only facilitate the monopolies goals."}

The reactor will also be owned by Russia, which will hold \"no less than a controlling stake,\" according to Sergey Kiriyenko, who is the head of Rosatom, a Russian nuclear energy corporation.\nThe reactor to be built is the second proposed power plant in the same location; a separate proposal for a four-reactor complex built by a Russian-led consortium was rejected by a Turkish court last year.  Russia has attempted to build a nuclear power plant in Turkey, and the contract signed Wednesday \"really looks rather impressive,\" according to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\nThe contract for the reactor was one of 20 signed by the two countries today, expected to result in around US$25billion of Russian investment in Turkey. Other major contracts signed include projects to transport Russian oil and natural gas through Turkey to ports on the Mediterranean Sea. One such project is a major pipeline between the Turkish ports of Samsun on the Black Sea and Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea, built in conjunction with an oil refinery in Ceyhan.\nIn a press conference, Russian President Medvedev said that the agreements signal \"a new page in our cooperation...Our talks today showed that Turkey and Russia are strategic partners not only in words but in deeds.\" Turkish President Abdullah Gul said that the two countries \"share a determination to increase the trade volume from a current US$38billion to US$100billion in five years.\""}

Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA, said that the Euro had been chosen as the currency of choice by criminal gangs due to the large denomination of the notes, adding \"[i]t should now be impossible now to buy a 500 note over the counter from one of the suppliers.  And that's going to have an effect on the criminals  it means they are going to have to find other means of trying to move their money.\"\nThe note was introduced by the European Central Bank in 2002, when the currency itself officially entered into circulation.  The notoriety of the note's criminal uses has earned it the nickname \"the Bin Laden\" after Al-Qaeda suspect Osama bin Laden  something that everyone knows is out there, but law-abiding people rarely see. The Euro is the official currency of 16 European countries, colloquially known as the Eurozone, as well as unofficially in a further 4 nations.\nSince its introduction, there has been mounting international concern over criminal use of the large denomination note, which facilitates money laundering by allowing large concentrations of cash to be concealed in small spaces, for example, 20,000 can be concealed in a cigarette packet and 1million in 500 notes weighs 2.2kg while the equivalent in 20 notes weighs 50kg. The highest denomination note in Sterling is 50, making high-value denominations in other currencies, such as the Euro, tempting for those wishing to move large amounts of money.  \nWhen asked if criminal demand for the note would simply be displaced to other high-value notes, such as the 200 note (the next-highest denomination), Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA said he believed that would be the case, however, with less of the 200 note in circulation, their movements would be easier to track than those of the 500.\nTourists returning to the UK from holidays in Europe will still be able to change their 500 notes for Sterling but will be unable to purchase them. The European Central Bank has no plans for a withdrawal of the note, given the legitimate demand for it in countries such as Germany and Italy, where cash is used far more frequently than alternatives such as credit cards.

The discovery was made during internal investigation resulting from earlier concerns by German regulators over the issue. Two weeks ago, Google told European officials that, while it did collect data from Wi-Fi services for location technologies, it did not save private user data.

Google Street View vehicles caught bits of information from unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks in both Europe and the United States, as well as around 30 other countries where Street View is used. Eustace said that Google has \"never used that data in any Google products\" and that it would stop the collection of Wi-Fi data altogether.

Previously, the oil company had tried to enclose the pipe with a large container dome, and then lowered a smaller \"top hat\" container dome. The siphon tube method is designed to reduce the amount of oil flowing into the ocean, but is not a permanent solution to stopping the leak altogether. It will draw the oil from the broken pipe to a tanker at the surface, said BP.\nThe tube was to be inserted into the broken pipe by robotic submarines, but the attempt on Friday to do so was unsuccessful, causing it to be taken back up for changes. The problem was a metal frame on the tube, which had changed position and this prevented the tube sent down from the drill ship Discover Enterprise from connecting. The tube had not been inserted into the leaking drill pipe before it was brought back up.\nBP said that it would try again Saturday night (local time) to slow the leak using a reconfigured tube. If this attempt is unsuccessful, they will use the smaller dome to cap the leak, and may also try to plug the leak by covering it with trash, mud, or concrete. The company is already in the process of drilling relief wells to completely stop the leak, but this is expected to take several more months.

They promise money, weight loss, or other things a person may strive for, but they usually amount to only a lighter pocket.  Online advertising has become something that the increasingly Internet-reliant society has become used to, as well as more aware of.  As this is true, online ads have become more intricate and deceptive in recent years.\nHowever, a certain type of advertisement has arisen recently, and has become more deceptive than any other Internet ad, and has tricked many users into credit card charges.  These sites claim to be news websites that preach a \"miracle product\", and they offer a free trial, and then charge the user's credit card a large amount of money without informing them after the trial ends.  These sites appear to be operating under one venture and have caught ad pages of high-traffic websites by storm.  In this report, Wikinews' Tjc6 investigates news advertisement sites.\nThese Internet ads work in different ways:\nHypothetically speaking, a reader is browsing the web, and then happens to come across something that they believe is too good to be true. A link on one of these high-traffic pages promises white teeth, weight loss, or huge profits from working at home part-time. Out of curiosity, they click on the link.\nThis is the way that people are attracted to these fake news sites on the internet. The domain owners draw in customers by purchasing advertising on some of the World Wide Web's most visited pages. Curious users click and are led to what they believe is a news article. From anti-aging to shedding weight, these \"articles\" from non-existant newspapers and television stations depict a skeptical news reporter trying a product because they were instructed to by a superior.\nAs the user reads on, they find that the \"reporter\" miraculously achieves significant weight loss, teeth whitening, or other general health and beauty improvement.  The reporter states that the reader can get the same results as they did by using a \"free trial\" of the product.\nNext, the user looks to the bottom of the page, where there seems to be a set of user comments, all of them praising the product or products that are advertised  this is where we first see something suspicious.  Across several of these false articles, the comments appear to show the exact same text, sometimes with even the same usernames as other sites.\nThere is obviously some kind of correlation. Although this appears to be true, most users who purchase these products do not look at multiple versions of these similar pages of what appears to be a fast-growing network of interconnected fake news sites.\nOnce customers have convinced themselves into buying the product, they are led to a product (or products) website which promises a free trial for a very low price.  What they do not know about this, however, is that they are giving their credit card data to a company that will charge it automatically after the trial ends.  In about 14 days, the user receives a charge on their credit card for an excessive amount of money, usually from about $80 to $100 (USD).  All attempts to contact these companies and cancel their shipments usually prove to be futile.\nWhat these sites have is a large amount of legal copy located at the bottom of each site, stating their right to charge the user.  This site, a fake news article claiming to offer teeth-whitening benefits, has several paragraphs of fine print, including this: \"...Upon signing up for the 10 day trial membership you will be charged up to $4.97 depending on various shipping and initial offer promotions at that time but not more than $4.97 upon signing.  If not cancelled, you will be charged $89.97 upon completion of the 10 day trial period.  Monthly thereafter or 30 days from the original order date, the charge will reoccur monthly at a total of $89.97 until cancelled...,\" the site says.\nPractices like this have alerted the Better Business Bureau, an American organization that studies and reports on the reliability and practices of US businesses. In a press release, a spokesman from the BBB spoke out against sites like this. \"Many businesses across the country are using the same selling model for their products: They lure customers in with claimed celebrity endorsements and free trial offers, and then lock them in by making it extremely difficult to cancel the automatic delivery of more products every month...,\" said the report that denounced the websites.\nWhen a user looks at several of these sites, they notice that all of them have the same exact structure. Because of this, Wikinews decided to look into where some of the domains were owned, and if they were all in fact part of one company.\nHowever, the results that Wikinews found were ones that were not expected.  Out of the three random websites that were found in Internet ads, all using similar designs and methods to attract the customers, came from three different locations in three countries and two separate continents.  The first came from Scottsdale, in the United States, while the next two came from Vancouver and Hamburg.  There is no location correlation, but surely, there has to be something that connected these sites together. We had to look even further to try to find a connection.\nThere is  some correlation within the product's contact information. A large amount of the teeth-whitening products analyzed actually shared the same phone number, which lead to a distribution center located in St. Petersburg, Florida, and several other similar distribution centers located across the Southern United States. But, that explains only one of the categories of products that these websites cover, teeth whitening. \nWhat about the other products? The other products such as weight loss and work-at-home kits all trace back to similar distribution centers in similar places. So, what do we make of all of this?\nThere is obviously some company that promotes these products through the fake news advertisements, but that company is nowhere to be found on the websites. All contact information is given on the product pages, and websites are copyrighted under the name of the domain, not a company. Whatever company has been the setup for these pages has been very good at hiding themselves from the Internet, as there is no information across the web about that mysterious large advertiser.\nAs a result of customers buying the products and having unauthorized charges on their credit cards, a large volume of complaints are currently present on awareness sites, complaint sites, and even the Better Business Bureau. Several customers point out that they were not informed of the steep charges and the company made it extremely difficult to cancel their subscription, usually resulting in the loss of several hundred dollars.\nOne notable lawsuit has occurred as a result of these articles.  Some of the articles about work at home kits specifically advertise things like \"work for Google\", or \"job openings at Google\".  However, Google asserts these claims as false and has taken the case to court, as it is a copyright violation.  \"Thousands of people have been tricked into sending payment information and being charged hidden fees by questionable operations,\" said Google in a statement.\nThe BBB has received over 3,000 complaints about products such as the ones that Google took offense to. The lawsuit has yet to begin in court, and no date has been set."}

A bacterium from different species then had its own genome removed and the synthetic one transplanted in its place. Venter's achievement is that the new genome switched on and the new cell was able to replicate.

However, Eu has said that Tsang should not use this debate as an excuse to avoid facing the public's concerns.\nThe action sparked critism from 'less extreme' pan-democratic political parties, such as the Democratic Party and other members of the Alliance for Universal Suffrage, who did not participate in the by-elections. Szeto Wah is worried that such an action would divide the pan-democrats. Martin Lee and Albert Ho have both denied that the television conference will have such an effect. Lee believes that Eu was a good choice as Ho is currently trying to compromise with the central government and was thus a less suitable candidate. Ho is also happy that Eu was invited. However, Rita Fan, who supports the television conference, said she \"sympathised\" with Ho for not being able to participate.\nOnly Eu and Tsang will participate in the conference, which caused a huge uproar in the political circles of Hong Kong. Eu is annoyed that public is unable to ask questions during the debate. Tsang replied that the public could participate by watching the television, while government representatives explained that this was because determining the eligibility of a person's entry was difficult, and it was easier for the two to debate fluently without the public asking questions.

Lee Cheuk-yan scoffed, \"[i]f that is the case, does that mean that everyone in the world can participate in the football matches by watching the World Cup?\" Fan said such participation was \"passive\" and \"one-sided\" as the public was not allowed to ask questions during the conference."}

The potential for loss in the Arctic is great.\"\nOdum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, \"Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions.  Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil.  In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond.\"\nHowever, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters. \nThis is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska.

Despite an unknown failure which caused the X-51 to lose acceleration, an X-51 program manager said that the USAF was \"ecstatic\" about the event's accomplishments.\nThe X-51 is 14 feet (4.2 metres) long and has no real wings, allowing it to withstand the shock wave created during flight. The aircraft launched around 10 a.m. PDT (1700 UTC) from Edwards Air Force Base in California. It was carried by a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress to a height of 50,000 feet (15,240 metres) and then released over the Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center Sea Range. The X-51 was then propelled by a solid rocket booster to Mach 4.8.\nAfter about 200 seconds in flight, Boeing said that \"something then occurred that caused the vehicle to lose acceleration. At that point, the X-51A was terminated as planned.\" Although it was expected to fly for about 300 seconds and reach Mach 6, the scramjet only managed Mach 5 at a height of about 70,000 feet (21,336 metres), possibly due to an engine blowout. The aircraft landed in the ocean as planned, and there are no plans to retrieve it.\nThis test is the first of four planned flights for the X-51 program, with the other three planned for this coming fall.

Leading up to the play, Blackhawk Marin Hossa has been sent to the penalty box for slashing, breaking the stick of a Flyers player.

A year after the swine flu pandemic was declared, stocks are left unused and governments try to abandon contracts, pharmaceutical companies have profited at least 4.6billion from the sale of vaccines alone.\nReports by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) and the Council of Europe claim that The World Health Organisation reaction to H1N1 was influenced by pharmaceutical companies and that key scientists behind advice had financial ties with firms Roche and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). These conflicts of interest have never been publicly disclosed by WHO, an apparent violation of its own rules.\nThe World Health Organisation issued H1N1 guidelines in 2004, recommending countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medication. The advice prompted many countries around the world into buying up large stocks of Tamiflu, made by Roche, and Relenza manufactured by GSK.\nA joint investigation with the BMJ and the BIJ, found that scientists involved in developing the WHO 2004 guidance had previously been paid by Roche or GSK for lecturing and consultancy work as well as being involved in research for the companies. \"The WHO's credibility has been badly damaged,\" BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said in an editorial.\nA report by the health committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-member human rights watchdog, found that the WHO's reaction was influenced by drug companies that make H1N1 antiviral drugs and vaccines. It criticised WHO lack of transparency around the handling of the swine flu pandemic and says the public health guidelines by WHO, EU agencies and national governments led to a \"waste of large sums of public money and unjustified scares and fears about the health risks faced by the European public.\"\nA spokesman for WHO said the drug industry did not influence its decisions on swine flu. Margaret Chan, the organisation's director, had dismissed inquiries into its handling of the A/H1N1 pandemic as \"conspiracy theories\" earlier this year, she had said: \"WHO anticipated close scrutiny of its decisions, but we did not anticipate that we would be accused, by some European politicians, of having declared a fake pandemic on the advice of experts with ties to the pharmaceutical industry and something personal to gain from increased industry profits.\"\nYesterday, a 16-member \"emergency committee\" consisting of advisors from the World Health Organisation said that the H1N1  pandemic is not yet over.  The WHO has refused to identify committee members, arguing that they must be shielded from industry pressure, so possible conflicts of interest with drug companies are unknown. The BMJ report also reveals that at least one expert on the \"emergency committee\" received payment during 2009 from GSK.\nIn related news, Reuters reported, Pfizer Inc, the world's biggest drugmaker, is selling its swine vaccine business to Chinese Harbin Pharmaceutical Group for $50 million."}

Their statement, released early this evening, indicates a formal ballot on strike action is inevitable  unless the company revises their two percent offer for 2010.\nThe deadline set by the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) passed at noon last Friday, apparently unheeded by BT. The union's announcement of their intent to ballot members apparently resulted in the offer  one with no new money on the table for this year.\nLast week, when their ultimatum was ignored, CWU deputy secretary general (DSG) Andy Kerr expressed deep disappointment, citing the substantial profits made by the company in the last financial year: \"[w]e're obviously very disappointed that BT has not improved its pay offer of 2% despite their healthy profits this year.\"\nThe turnaround from losses of 244 million to a billion-pound-plus profit has, the union claims, galvanised their membership into seriously considering industrial action. Reports of senior directors receiving million-pound bonuses, and former Labour minister Patricia Hewitt landing over over 50,000 extra per-year, are characterised as \"directors' 'snouts in the trough'\". Hewitt was suspended from her parliamentary party in March over cash-for-access accusations, and works two to three days each month on BT's remuneration committee.\nThe UK's Press Association described the now-rejected offer as being worth 2% this year, and an additional 3% in 2011 with staff bonuses of up to 250. The package supposedly contains pledges on no compulsory redundancies and the return of call centre and non-frontline work from outsource companies in India.\nWikinews called both the Communication Workers' Union, and British Telecom, seeking clarification on a number of points. Richard Knowles, a BT press officer in London, forwarded their terse sub-400-word statement, refusing to be drawn on reports that the offer includes the repatriation of call centre and back-office jobs. When challenged on this work being carried out in a jurisdiction with less-stringent data protection, and computer misuse legislation, our reporter was referred back to the company's statement.\nSian Jones of the CWU's Press Office, commenting prior to the union's evening statement, remarked that repatriation of call centre work was an issue that the union had prior, unrelated, discussions with BT about; she gave no indication to Wikinews this was, or was not, part of BT's revised offer.\nThe press release, shortly after 1630 BST, expressed clear intent to carry on with the process of balloting members on strike action. In the statement, CWU DGS Andy Kerr states, \"[w]e're very disappointed that BT's revised offer remains materially unchanged for this year in terms of pay.\"\nContinuing, he emphasised, \"[...] we've made clear, 2 per cent is unacceptable for our members as it does not reflect the reward they expect given the contribution they have made to cost savings of 1.75 billion and profits of over 1bn. In addition, inflation is at 5.3 per cent and staff are comparing this offer with the large salary rises and bonuses for senior executives which expose the blatant double standards being adopted by the company when it comes to remuneration.\"\nThe CWU statement also expresses concern over BT's disclosure of details within the offer; \"BT's decision to leak their offer to the media today has also raised trust issues for us with the company.\"\nAny sustained action by CWU members in BT's employ could have a major impact on the country's communication infrastructure. Millions of UK households and businesses are reliant on BT for internet access  in addition to telephony services.\nFollowing the release of their statement, the CWU's Sian Jones confirmed that the union had not, as-yet, given BT the formal seven-days notice of balloting members on strike action.\nAny ballot would run for a two-week period; following such, the union would, again, be required to give seven days notice to BT; this time of their intent to take workers out on strike. She emphasised, \"nobody wants to be on strike\", stressing that the union last took such action in 1987, and would prefer round-table discussions and an improved offer.\nThe structure of BT's privatisation, and breakup to permit level playing-field telephony and broadband competition, would see other Internet service providers who rely on the ageing, once GPO-owned, copper POTS infrastructure unable to resolve customer faults. According to the CWU, BT has been querying managerial staff on their skillsets  as a form of preparation for any industrial action. A union spokesperson described this as \"laughable\".\nWhen called for comment on the union's rejection of their revised offer, the BT press office declined to comment at this time."}

This feature is called FaceTime, and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi. The phone has two cameras: one on the front for video chats, and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos. The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels, is capable of recording high-definition video, and has an LED flash.\nThe iPhone 4 will use Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 4. Formerly \"iPhone OS,\" iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April, and includes multitasking capabilities. Jobs called the new software \"the most advanced mobile operating system in the world.\" iOS will support Apple's new mobile advertising service, iAd, which goes live on July 1.\niPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. It comes in two colorsblack and whiteand two storage capacities. The 16GB version is priced at US$199 and the 32GB version at US$299. The iPhone 3GS's price will be reduced to US$99, and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued. iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices (including the 3GS) on June 21. In the U.S., iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&T's cellular network, despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers, such as Verizon.\nCompetition-wise, the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now. Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google's Android operating system, as well as Palm's webOS. Earlier this year, Android phones managed to outsell iPhones. iPhone users, however, account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications, commonly called \"apps,\" have been purchased from Apple's App Store.

The research contrasts with the views of other writers in the field, who argue that pre-school children achieve the best results when cared for by their parents full-time.\nKathy Sylva, Professor of Educational Psychology at the university, has based her findings upon data from the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project.  This has been running since 1996, tracking the development of 3,000 children to discover the effects upon their development of pre-school care and education. \nSylva told The Sunday Times that \"[a] lot of parents worry unnecessarily about this issue but my research shows that the vast majority of children are not impaired on any measure by attending nursery under the age of two\", although she admits that there is an increased risk for children from deprived background, and for boys.  Those attending better-quality nurseries go on to make better relationships when they start school, she says, and urges parents to check the standards of nurseries for themselves.\nHer conclusions come in the wake of a vast expansion in nursery care provision in the United Kingdom in recent years, aimed at getting mothers of young children back to work.  One study states that 5% of \"middle-class\" parents in Britain put their children in full-time nursery care.\nAccording to others such as the child psychologist Oliver James, however, full-time care by parents gives the best results for children. James states that there is evidence that nursery care is \"highly stressful and can be harmful\", since levels of the hormone cortisol double after one hour in day care, and raised levels can be detected for some months afterwards. Sylva agrees, though, that some children who attend nursery before they are two are slightly more aggressive at primary school  a finding in line with other research  but says that this aggression disappears by the time the child reaches eleven.\nSylva, a Professorial Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, was awarded the OBE in 2008.

Television cameras captured a white speck, presumably part of the rocket, falling into the sea.\nAnalysts say the failure is a setback for South Korea. If it had been successful, it would have been the first Naro-1 launch to reach orbit. The launch cost South Korea an estimated US$400 million, and if successful, would have launched a satellite called the STSAT-2B into orbit.

Researchers published details in the journal PLoS ONE.\nThe leather shoe was found in a cave dubbed Areni-1, near the village of Areni in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia, on the Iranian and Turkish borders.  \"I was amazed to find that even the shoe-laces were preserved,\" recalled Diana Zardaryan, the Armenian PhD student who made the discovery.\nAccording to researchers, the shoe, made of cow-hide, consists of only one leather piece and was probably customised to the wearer's foot. It was relatively small, measuring the corresponding to European size 37 or US size 7 women, however, it could have been worn by a man.\nIt was kept in excellent condition by a thick layer of sheep excrement, which acted as a seal, helping it survive the millennia. The shoe contained grass, although the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was to used to maintain the shape of the shoe and/or prepare it for storage.\n\"We thought initially that the shoe and other objects were about 600-700 years old because they were in such good condition,\" said  co-author Dr. Ron Pinhasi from the University College Cork in Ireland. \"It was only when the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in Oxford and in California that we realised that the shoe was a few hundred years older than the shoes worn by tzi the Iceman\".\nThe shoe and the cave will continue to be researched. \"We do not know yet what the shoe or other objects were doing in the cave or what the purpose of the cave was\", said Pinhasi, \"We know that there are children's graves at the back of the cave but so little is known about this period that we cannot say with any certainty why all these different objects were found together\".\nCurrently, the oldest known footwear are sandals made from sagebrush bark, found in Fort Rock Cave, Oregon in the United States.  These shoes were discovered in 1938, and have been dated to about 10,000 years before present.\nDiscoveries within the cave move early bronze-age cultural activity in Armenia back by about 800 years.

She departed from Marina del Rey, California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning. That night, an Australian plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, Wild Eyes, which had lost its mast earlier.\nSunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over. The mast broke off as a consequence. After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual distress radiobeacons, or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed. As part of the operation, a Qantas Airways Airbus A330 was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities. The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing. The closest rescue boat, a French fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today. She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.\nThis is not Sunderland's first obstacle during the journey. Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power. She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at Cape Town, South Africa for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.\nSunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat.  They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter.

The ICRC describes how the blockade has seriously impoverished the people of Gaza, as well as denying them basic access to housing, food and health care. The ICRC claims the blockade has almost totally destroyed Gaza's economy, which is kept on life support by an elaborate tunnel system used to smuggle in goods. Even though Israel has stated that it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, the ICRC said that the country still denies Gazans access to their fishing grounds, causing great economic hardship.\nOutlining the condition of the health care system in Gaza, the ICRC stated that electricity blackouts are on average seven hours a day, meaning that hospitals must run on generators. Generators can take two to three minutes to start, a luxury many patients cannot afford. To make matters worse fuel supplies for the generators are erratic, and the ICRC reported that already three times in 2010 Gaza's hospitals have run out of fuel.\nThe statement also highlighted a potential risk to Gaza's water supply. According to the ICRC, only 60% of Gaza's 1.4 million inhabitants are connected to a sewage collection system, and raw sewage is dumped into the Wadi Gaza river, posing a great health risk to many families living alongside the river, where overused aquifers results in drinking water unfit for consumption with \"high levels of nitrate, chloride and salt\".  \nThe ICRC has urged for the rights of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who is held prisoner by Hamas, to be respected. On Israeli-held prisoners, the ICRC state that \"Over 800 Gazan detainees in Israeli prisons have been prevented from meeting face-to-face with their loved ones since June 2007.\""}

He was described by The Daily Telegraph as \"one of the most distinguished contemporary English language poets\" and by the former Poet Laureate Andrew Motion as \"one of the two or three best poets writing in English\". He obtained 1,156 votes with his nearest rival, Michael Horovitz, receiving 353.

Motion applauded Hill's success, saying that Oxford was \"lucky to have him.\" Horovitz said that Hill would \"probably give great lectures but they won't be anything different\", and suggested that Hill, \"like his poetry, won't be that accessible.\"\nThe 2010 election follows the controversy of 2009, which saw candidate Derek Walcott withdraw before the contest after anonymous letters were sent to more than 100 Oxford academics giving details of an allegation of sexual harassment made against him in 1982.

She said that the process was \"seriously flawed\" and favoured Hill. The 2010 election was the first to allow voting by email: previously, voters had to visit Oxford and cast their votes in person.  The 2,500 votes in this election compares to less than 500 cast in the 2009 contest, as against a total potential electorate (all the graduates and academics of the university) in the region of 300,000.\nThe post of Professor of Poetry dates from 1708, and former holders include Seamus Heaney and W.

The ceremony took place at Stockholm Cathedral.\nOver 1,200 guests, including many rulers, politicians, royals and other dignitaries from across the world, attended the wedding, which cost an estimated 20 million Swedish kronor. Victoria wore a wedding dress with five-metre long train designed by Pr Engsheden. She wore the same crown that her mother, Queen Silvia, wore on her wedding day 34 years previously, also on June 19. Victoria's father, King Carl XVI Gustaf, walked Victoria down the aisle, which was deemed untraditional by many. In Sweden, the bride and groom usually walk down the aisle together, emphasising the country's views on equality. Victoria met with Daniel half-way to the altar, where they exchanged brief kisses, and, to the sounds of the wedding march, made their way to the the silver altar. She was followed by ten bridesmaids. The couple both had tears in their eyes as they said their vows, and apart from fumbling when they exchanged rings, the ceremony went smoothly.\nFollowing the ceremony, the couple headed a fast-paced procession through central Stockholm on a horse-drawn carriage, flanked by police and security. Up to 500,000 people are thought to have lined the streets. They then boarded the Vasaorden, the same royal barge Victoria's parents used in their wedding, and traveled through Stockholm's waters, accompanied by flyover of 18 fighter jets near the end of the procession. A wedding banquet followed in the in the Hall of State of the Royal Palace.\nControversy has surrounded the engagement and wedding between the Crown Princess and Westling, a \"commoner\". Victoria met Westling as she was recovering from bulemia in 2002. He owned a chain of gymnasiums and was brought in to help bring Victoria back to full health. Westling was raised in a middle-class family in Ockelbo, in central Sweden. His father managed a social services centre, and his mother worked in a post office. When the relationship was made public, Westling was mocked as an outsider and the king was reportedly horrified at the thought of his daughter marrying a \"commoner\", even though he did so when he married Silvia. Last year, Westling underwent transplant surgery for a congenital kidney disorder. The Swedish public have been assured that he will be able to have children and that his illness will not be passed on to his offspring.\nWestling underwent years of training to prepare for his new role in the royal family, including lessons in etiquette, elocution, and multi-lingual small talk; and a makeover that saw his hair being cropped short, and his plain-looking glasses and clothes being replaced by designer-wear.\nUpon marrying the Crown Princess, Westling took his wife's ducal title and is granted the style \"His Royal Highness\". He is now known as HRH Prince Daniel, Duke of Vstergtland. He also has his own coat-of-arms and monogram. When Victoria assumes the throne and becomes Queen, Daniel will not become King, but assume a supportive role, similar to that of Prince Phillip, the husband of the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II."}

The Legislative Council (LegCo) lawmakers are scheduled to cast their ballots tomorrow to decide whether or not the proposal will be accepted, and it is highly likely that the proposal will be approved.\nYesterday night, the Democratic Party held a long meeting to debate on the controversial issue. After five hours, consensus aroused in the Party to accept the package, with only 63 opposed to the LegCo part of the proposal and 71 to the Chief Executive part, as compared to 246 and 237 in support of the LegCo and Chief Executive parts respectively. \"The decision is not just a historical one for the Democratic Party, but also a milestone for the city's progress in democracy,\" said the Party chairman Albert Ho.\nUnder the new revision, ten constituencies would be added to the original 60 of the LegCo, five of which are functional constituencies and would be voted by elected district councilors. Those who are not elected will not be permitted to vote. This allows the people to indirectly participate in the election.\nThe vice president of China, Xi Jinping had approved the amended proposal in order to prevent Hong Kong's political situation from worsening. The Executive Council also approved the proposal, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang said there is a 'ray of hope' for the democratic development of Hong Kong as a result. The decision broke the stalemate between the government and the Democratic Party. According to Ming Pao, the decision also improved the chances of Xi Jinping's becoming the next president.\nThe proposal is also popular among the Pro-Beijing political parties, such as the DAB, Federation of Trade Unions, and Liberal Party. Politicians Elsie Leung, Rita Fan and Tsang Hin-chi also support the proposal, the former stating that the proposal was 'worthy of consideration'.\nHowever, the proposal received heavy criticism among radical democrats, including the League of Social Democrats (LSD) and the Civic Party, as well as the general public. The LSD met outside the Causeway Bay branch of the Professional Teachers' Union, where the Democratic Party's meeting was held, to protest. They stepped onto a roasted pigeon, symbolising the Democratic Party as the Party's logo included a dove. They waved placards with the names of seven of the party's lawmakers and condemned them for being \"democracy sinners.\" The Party had also protested when Ho participated in the City Forum and during a meeting of the Alliance for Universal Suffrage.\nDuring the City Forum, where Ho, Audrey Eu of the Civic Party and a National People's Congress representative talked, LSD members frequently booed and attacked Ho. Even after Franklin Wong rescued Ho and put him in his car, some 'Brothers of Victoria Park' still surrounded the car, and police officers had to protect Ho so that he could leave. During the above mentioned meeting, many people claiming to be previous supporters of the Democratic Party accused the Party of betraying them, including a 80-year-old man called Chan, a 31-year-old named Cheung and an unnamed middle-aged woman.\nThese actions were condemned by Democratic Party members, including Szeto Wah, Emily Lau, and Cheung Man-kwong. Ho said that, 'when extreme leftists and rightists attack you, you know that are in the right track'.\nHowever, not all Democratic Party members supported the proposal. Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic Party, had earlier vowed to leave the party should the package be backed. He stated that he was bitterly disappointed, and needed two weeks' time to consider whether he should quit or not. Party member Andrew Cheng also opposed the proposal, as did James To. The former is thinking of leaving the party.\nHo says he will try to persuade the two to support the package in private. It has been predicted that once Lee and Cheng leave the party, around 20 members will follow their lead, putting the unity of the party at stake and leaving the party to face its greatest danger since 2000."}

At first he was thought to have been suffering from heat exhaustion and severe dehydration but other medical conditions developed. On Sunday, his condition was described as \"serious\".\nByrd was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952 and to the U.S. Senate in 1958. He suffered from ill health in recent years but retained his reputation for securing millions in federal funding for his home state.\nThroughout his career in the U.S Senate he held positions including Senate Majority Whip, Majority Leader twice and Minority Leader once. Due to his status as the longest serving Senator, Byrd was serving as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, which made him third in line in the Presidential line of succession. Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii has been sworn in as the new President pro tempore.\nByrd served nine terms in the Senate and was labeled by critics as the \"King of Pork\". He used his former chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee to steer over one billion dollars in federal aid to West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the country, described by him as, \"one of the rock bottomest [sic] of states\".\nByrd took the title to heart and had no apologies about it, saying, \"Pork, to the critic, is service to the people who enjoy some of the good things in life, and I've been happy to bring to West Virginia the projects to which they refer. I have no apology for it.\"\nByrd was originally born as Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr. on November 20, 1917. He grew up in the coal mining regions of southern West Virginia with his aunt and uncle, who adopted him following the death of his mother in the 1918 flu pandemic. He was the valedictorian of his high school class, but could not afford college and did not attend university courses until his 30s and 40s.\nThe Senator had a fondness for history, and included excerpts of poetry, Shakespeare, Greek and Roman classics along with verses from the Bible in his Senate speeches. He considered himself a staunch defender of United States Constitution, and carried a copy of it in his pocket. Byrd was versed in parliamentary procedure using some of the Senate's arcane rules to his advantage. He received awards from the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians for significant contributions to history.\nByrd had his share of controversy. He was at one time a member of the Ku Klux Klan, serving as the top officer of his local chapter and once held racial segregationist views. Byrd was involved in the filibuster against the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which he voted against. Byrd later explicitly and repeatedly denounced his former segregationist views.\nByrd is the only Senator to have voted against the nominations of African-American Supreme Court justices Thurgood Marshall and Marshall's successor following his retirement, Clarence Thomas. Byrd's opposition of Thomas was based on the testimony of Anita Hill who accused Thomas of sexually harassing her and due to the fact that Byrd felt Thomas was \"injecting racism\" into the debate by using the phrase \"high-tech lynching of uppity blacks\" in his defense against the allegations.\nByrd, who supported the Vietnam War, was one of the most outspoken critics of the War in Iraq. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Byrd spoke on the eve the invasion saying, \"Today I weep for my country. [...] No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned. Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination.\""}

At least six people were injured with wounds of varying seriousness, all of which were hospitalised; conflicting media reports, however, suggested that the number of hurt passengers was substantially more. According to Czech media, the dead man was the train's driver.\nAccording to the press-secretary of the local fire department, the train went off the rails a few hundred metres from the station.\nPreliminary investigation has revealed that the train derailed when crossing a railroad switch 58 km/h faster than authorized.  The safe speed limit is 120 km/h when the switch, also known as a turnout or a set of points, is set to a straight path, and 50 km/h when the switch is set to divert the train to another track.  In this case, the switch was set to divert, but the train's speed is reported to have been 108 km/h.\nThe accident happened on one of the most important railroads in the country, which is double-tracked, electrified and used daily by long-distance international trains.  Therefore it is checked often, and investigators consider track failure to be improbable. Investigators have ruled out signal malfunction. Media reports suggest two possible reasons for the derailment: driver's error or brake malfunction.\nTrain operations on the line from st nad Labem to the capital Prague had to be cancelled as a result of the crash.

I also concluded that the two other constables, during their testimony before me, offered patently unbelievable after-the-fact rationalizations of their police notes and their statements to the [RCMP Integrated Homicide Investigation Team] investigators.\nRCMP Commissioner William J.S.

The source of the explosion was first thought to have been a 2,000-pound (907.2-kilogramme) hydrogen tank, but fire officials later said that this was not the case. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation by the Columbia Fire Department.\nThe Columbia Fire Department arrived at Schweitzer Hall after a report of a structure fire, but found that most of the fire had already been extinguished by the building's fire sprinkler system. The remaining flames were put out by firefighters, one of whom said it looked as if \"a bomb went off in the lab\".\nOf the four hurt in the blast, one was a research scientist, one a graduate student, and the other two postdoctoral fellows. Three were treated for mild injuries and released from University Hospital, while the fourth was in good condition after being taken to the hospital's burn unit for life-threatening injuries. A school spokesperson said that the university was not allowed to release the names of the victims.\nAuthorities initially believed that a large container of hydrogen gas had exploded, but investigators later said that the tank was intact. Fire officials also retracted an earlier statement that said the incident had been a result of human error. In a Monday night news release, the fire department said that lab workers had turned on the hydrogen but did not recognize warning signs indicating a dangerously high level of hydrogen gas in the lab, so they left the gas supply running. The report said the explosion occurred after the gas reached a source of ignition. However, the department said Tuesday that the investigation into the explosion is still ongoing and that they were not certain human error was the cause.\nThe investigation should determine the cost of repairs for the building, as well as whether the school should implement new procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. The lab where the explosion took place will be totally rebuilt.\nSchweitzer Hall houses Mizzou's biochemistry department, which is part of the medical and agricultural programs.

The Fourth of July is a time when many US families get together to celebrate, by holding reunions, picnics, barbecues, baseball games and firework displays; however, celebrations often turn sour due to injury or even death, caused by the mishandling of fireworks. In 2009, nearly 19,000 fireworks-related injuries were treated in hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics all over the country. Around 9,000 of those were to children aged under 18, and 6,000 occurred during the 30 days surrounding Independence Day.\nCPSC chairman, Inez Tenenbaum, said that burns and cuts to limbs, the face and head were the most common injuries, and over half of them were due to firecrackers, rockets and sparklers. The agencies were joined at the news conference by Jason Henderson, who was injured in 2007 after building home-made fireworks. He had found instructions online detailing how to build M-80-style fireworks, and after purchasing the chemicals, began assembling them; however, the mixture exploded which resulted in him losing both hands and his right eye, and shrapnel caused multiple lacerations and puncture wounds to his entire body. \"Don't be the show, go and enjoy the show. I want to get people to move away from putting on their own displays and just go and enjoy the free shows. I mean they are free,\" Henderson said. \"You might as well take advantage of them while they are there. You can spend time with your family instead of being the one to light them and taking that risk.\" Henderson also appears in a public-service announcement recently released by the ATF to YouTube, that shows how he has now been fitted with bionic arms.\nAgencies recommend attending community fireworks shows held by city or county officials, which are held in a more controlled and professional environment. Additionally, many jurisdictions outlaw either all fireworks, or certain types, such as rockets and firecrackers.\nFireworks increase demands on fire departments and personnel at this time of year, acting U.S. Fire Administrator Glenn Gaines noted. \"Four firefighters [have been killed] as a result of illegal fireworks. Calls to EMS [Emergency Medical Services] and fire departments increased as individuals continue to be injured and burned.\" The dry weather and heat that many areas are experiencing also elevate the risk of brush and structure fires. The National Fire Protection Association said that over 22,500 fires started from fireworks in 2008.\nConsumers who do purchase fireworks are encouraged to follow the following common sense rules: always read and follow directions; always supervise older children and teenagers if they are permitted to use fireworks; never allow young children to play with or ignite fireworks, child-friendly sparklers and \"party-poppers\" are a fun and safe alternative for them; keep animals inside or well away from the fireworks, the noise will often scare them; never light any fireworks inside buildings; light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from houses, dry leaves, and flammable materials; never ignite fireworks in metal or glass containers; light one firework at a time; move away to a safe distance immediately after lighting a firework; never return to a firework that has not ignited properly; never throw fireworks at another person, animal, or property; do not consume alcohol when using fireworks; keep a bucket of water or a hose in close proximity in case of fire, dispose of use fireworks in the bucket of water; buy from reliable dealers; only use legal fireworks; and follow the laws of your jurisdiction."}

Later, head of Investigating Committee of the Prosecution Office Alexander Bastrykin said he will \"personally check\" the course of investigation into actions by Kuznetsov and his coworkers. In 2007 and 2008, Magnitsky worked in Russia for American investment fund company Hermitage Capital Management and was involved in the disclosure of a large-scale corruption among several top law enforcement officials in Moscow. \nLawyers concerned with the death of Magnitsky, which occurred in Butyrka prison on November 16 of last year, started the bilingual website russian-untouchables.com, where they presented evidence of Artem Kuznetsov's alleged efforts to cloak the crimes. As reported by the website's authors, Kuznetsov was a key player in a US$230 million theft from the Russian government and then successfully brought criminal charges against everyone who reported his theft. \nThe central part of website material is a ten-minute video providing a summary of the case. Its main point is the fact that multiple large-scale luxury buyings registered to members of Kuznetsov's family; they are not comparable to official income of all of these persons. It is emphasized in the video that Kuznetsov's official monthly income is $850 per month (in roubles), and to gain all the assets found to be connected with him he would have to work for 322 years. The video was released in the middle of last week, and gained enormous popularity within Russian blogosphere, and drew attention of some mass media. \nOne of the American lawyers, Jamison Firestone, states at the website that last month he directed several petitions to check the sources of Kuznetsov's family wealth to Russian authorities: the President of Russia, Prosecutor General Yury Chaika, Department for Own Safety and Department for Preventing Corruption and Other Crimes of Interior Ministry. News website Lenta.ru states that addresses were directed on May, 21, but there were no replies since then.\nMagnitsky's case has received international attention for several months. In April 2010 US Senator Ben Cardin proposed the cancellation of US visas to 60 Russian officials allegedly connected with Magnitsky's death. He directed an appeal to US State Secretary Hillary Clinton.\nThere has been no decision on it yet, but last Tuesday Clinton urged Russia to bring officials responsible for the death of Magnitsky to justice, The Daily Telegraph says. She told the US-Russia \"Civil Society to Civil Society\" summit in Washington that the Obama administration is \"deeply concerned about the safety of journalists and human rights activists in Russia\". In the meantime Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were meeting last week during Medvedev's visit to US.\nMagnitsky's advocates emphasize that Kuznetsov, since committing his crimes, was promoted in service; previously, he was working for the Department of Tax Crimes of the Central Internal Affairs Directorate of Moscow, and at the start of 2010 began to work in Department for Economic Safety of the Interior Ministry. Recently there were many cases when civil groups and private persons publicly reported alleged large-scale corruption crimes within top Russian authorities, with some evidence provided."}

His final prediction, for Sunday's final between Spain and the Netherlands, was broadcast live on television.  The eight-legged sea creature was given two boxes to choose from  one marked with a flag from the Netherlands and another with the flag of Spain.  In the end it was the Spanish flag he went for.\nRupert Adams of William Hill, one of Britain's largest bookmakers, said that the octopus's success rate is remarkable.\n\"If you had had ten pounds on each and every prediction then re-invested your winnings you would currently have over 1,450 pounds,\" said Adams.  \"It's an astonishing feat to get six predictions in a row.  I am told people are walking into our shops and saying 'I will have what the Octopus predicted.'\"\nBut David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, was less convinced of the animal's abilities, pointing out that many other creatures failed to predict the correct outcomes of matches and went unreported.\n\"It's like seeing footage of a golfer getting a hole-in-one,\" Spiegelhalter said. \"We're not seeing the millions of times the golfer made the shot and it didn't go in.\"\nAt least one other animal has weighed in on the World Cup final.

Erick Erickson sent around the most rancid and arguably racist tweets, only to thereafter be hired as a CNN contributor.\"\nLebanese author and academic Dr. As'ad Abu-Khalil has also argued that commentators have not properly placed Fadlallah in context, and pointed to the schools and orphanages he founded in Beirut and southern Lebanon. Amira Al Hussaini of Global Voices quotes Abu-Khalil's post, saying \"His [Fadlallah's] relationship with Hizbullah is always misunderstood...he broke from Wilayat Al-Faqih...and developed a new liberal thinking especially on issues of personal status laws.\" He also \"urged for a closer relationship between science and religion\", which drew the ire of both Iran and Hizbullah. \nNasr herself clarified her comment the day before her dismissal on a post to her CNN blog, saying that she used the words \"respect\" and \"sad\" because \"to me as a Middle Eastern woman, Fadlallah took a contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics on woman's rights.

However, the ARM says in its mid-year report, titled \"Civilian Casualties of Conflict\", that the move failed to have any lasting effect, and that \"the insurgency has become more resilient, multi-structured and deadly\".\nAccording to the ARM, most of the injuries and deaths were attributed homemade bombs  otherwise known as improvised explosive devices. These bombs are considered the Taliban's main weapon.\n140,000 soldiers from both the US and NATO are stationed in Afghanistan; another 10,000 are scheduled to enter the landlocked Asian country in the next few weeks. Over 350 US and NATO troops have been killed so far this year, compared with 520 last year. Over 30 troops have been killed in the first 12 days of July."}

Though the film director pled guilty to rape and unlawful sexual intercourse, he fled to France before he could be sentenced. \nA top U.S. Justice Department official, Lanny Breuer, has said that he is \"deeply disappointed\" with the Swiss decision, and that the U.S. request that Polanski be sent to the United States was completely supported by treaty, facts and the law. Also, U.S. State Department spokesman  P.J. Crowley said \"The rape of a 13-year-old girl by an adult who should know better, and that does know better, is a crime. We will continue to seek justice in this case, and we will evaluate our options.\"\nBreuer also stated that the U.S. government will review its options. However, Switzerland has said no appeal to its decision was possible. Polanski was arrested last September by Swiss police when he arrived in Zurich to receive a lifetime career award at a film festival. The Swiss were acting on a request from the U.S. government.\nThe Swiss Justice Ministry based its decision on the fact that it was unable to determine whether Polanski had already served the full sentence for his crime. This was due to the Los Angeles Superior Court in May ruling that the records of the closed-door 1977 hearings had to remain secret. The Swiss Justice Ministry said U.S. officials should have backed up their request by providing confidential testimony about Polanski's 1977 sentencing procedure in Los Angeles. In past hearings, Polanski's lawyers argued that there were irregularities in the original handling of the case, and U.S. judge Peter Espinoza agreed there was misconduct by the original judge."}

During the testing period, which could last anywhere from six to forty-eight hours, all undersea oil containment systems will be temporarily suspended. The company made clear that, even if the tests succeed, this does not mean that oil leakage has permanently ceased. \nDoug Suttles, a BP executive, explained that during the test, the well pressure will be carefully monitored. Suttles said at a Monday briefing that the ideal would be for tests to show high pressure around the seal, indicating that no oil is escaping. He also stated that on the other hand, the pressures could be lower than anticipated, leading to the assumption that the well is damaged and is leaking oil and gas into surrounding rock. If this were to happen, keeping the cap shut could further damage the well. The solution for this scenario is to reopen the valves and funnel most, if not all, of the oil to ships above.\nDrilling of the first relief well was suspended until completion of the integrity test. Kent Wells explained at his Wednesday morning briefing that the first relief well is now 4 feet from the original well and there is a remote possibility that the pressure test could open a path to the relief well. Drilling of the second relief well has stopped at 16,000 feet so as not to interfere with the first well and to keep routing options open in case the first relief well fails. Even if the pressure tests do succeed and the main well is shut, work on the first relief well will continue until it intercepts the main well. When this occurs, mud and cement will be pumped into the well for a permanent seal. Containment and clean up operations will continue even after the relief wells are finished to deal with oil already released.\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing eleven and marking the start of the worst offshore oil spill in United States history."}

Paleontologist Iyad Zalmout of the University of Michigan discovered the new species, Saadanius hijazensis near Mecca in Saudi Arabia; the discovery gives new insights into human evolution.\nThe specimen, a partial skull, dates to the Oligocene, approximately 29 to 28million years ago, and exhibits puncture wounds from a large predator that may have killed it.  Saadanius is thought to have been a tree-dweller and lived at a time when the Arabian peninsula had not yet split away from the African continent, forming the Red Sea.  The discovery may help resolve the dating of the split between Old World monkeys and apes.  Paleoanthropologists have traditionally dated the divergence to between 25 and 23million years ago, based on early fossils of the two groups.  Genetic studies, however, date it to between 30 to 35million years ago.\nAlthough Saadanius shares some features with living catarrhine primates, such as a bony ear tube, called an ectotympanic, it also possesses other features more common in the fossils of primitive or basal catarrhines, from which Old World monkeys and apes did not evolve.

During the event, company CEO Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone's antenna. Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix, Jobs said yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.\nThe rubber cases, or \"bumpers\", wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues.

For consumers still dissatisfied with iPhone 4, Jobs said that the phones can be returned for a refund as well.\nJobs acknowledged that \"a very small percentage of users\" were experiencing antenna issues, but dismissed the existence of an \"Antennagate,\" saying that similar problems plague all cellular phones and that the iPhone issue \"has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible.\" He showed videos demonstrating a drop in signal strength when held in a certain way for other smartphones to help make his point.\nAccording to company statistics, about one out of every 200 iPhone 4 customers have called AppleCare to complain about the antenna. The iPhone 4 return rate is about one-third of the iPhone 3GS return rate. However, Jobs admitted that the percentage of calls dropped on the iPhone 4 was slightly greater than the percentage of calls dropped on the 3GS. Jobs attributed the small increase to fewer iPhone 4 users putting cases on their devices.\nIn response to critics saying that Apple had not addressed the reception problem quickly enough, Jobs said that iPhone 4 had only been out for 22 days and that the company could not have resolved the issue any faster. The press event came just days after Consumer Reports declined to give Apple's newest phone a \"recommended\" rating due to the antenna's placement. The group said that Apple's move to give away free cases is a good first step, but not permanent enough to earn a higher rating.\nEarlier, on June 24, Apple told customers to either hold the phone without covering the antenna, or to use a case.

{"id": 1121, "ended": true, "text": "After an investigation, Wikinews has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the Deepwater Horizon leak.\nA nearly four and a half minute video posted on YouTube on June 13 was from the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1. It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13. The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.\nUntil now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well. Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV UTM Distance Calculator.' Using the coordinates for the location of the Deepwater Horizon, and the location of the Viking Poseidon on June 13, Wikinews was able to determine that the first rupture and leak was approximately 50.45 feet from the leaking well or \"21.56 feet [n]orth and 45.61 feet [w]est\" of the Deepwater leak point.\nHiggins told Wikinews how he created the calculator, and says it is \"very accurate,\" but that the tool would \"not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to New Orleans.\"\n\"This tool was created using java script that uses basic Pythagorean theorem (\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nB\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A^{2}+B^{2}=C^{2}}\n\n) to calculate the distance between two points. The distance is simply \n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nN\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n(\n\nE\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {(N_{1}-N_{2})^{2}+(E_{1}-E_{2})^{2}}}}\n\n. ROV coordinates match the location within a few feet when looking at the well because obviously the ROV can not be over the exact center because that is where the BOP is,\" said Higgins.\nBP, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor.  On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of BP, said on their official Twitter page that \"4 ROVs using sonar scanning [are] looking for anomalies in seabed floor.  No indications any oil or gas escaping.\"  Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the United States Coast Guard said that \"no anomalies\" were found, but also that the tests were \"not comprehensive.\"\nOn Sunday, Wikinews contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation.  According to their office in London, England, they \"sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found.\"  They also stated that they \"have continued to monitor\" and \"have also carried out seismic surveys.  Nothing found to give concern.\"  Wikinews also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.\nHowever, on July 18, the Associated Press reported that there was \"seepage\" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted.  \"If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is.\"\nSince the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor.  One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side.  It then immediately retreated to the surface.  Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally.  One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the Pacific Ocean.  Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface.  In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well.\n\"The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico. By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period,\" said Cutler Cleveland, a Boston University professor at the university's  Department of Geography and Environment.\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours. Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.\n\"We are feeling more comfortable we have integrity. We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward. The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it,\" said Allen."}

The team used the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, and data archived from the Hubble Space Telescope. The newly discovered star, designated R136a1, was discovered in the R136 star cluster.\nThe researchers estimate that the current mass of the star is about 265 solar masses, and could have been about 320 solar masses just after its birth.\n\"Unlike humans,\" says Crowther, \"these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age.  Being a little over a million years old, the most extreme star R136a1 is already middle-aged, and has undergone an intense weight loss programme, shedding a fifth of its initial mass over that time, or more than 50 solar masses.\"\nAstronomers not involved in the discovery, while still impressed, warn of the small possibility that the team could have mistaken two relatively close stars for one large one.\n\"What they're characterizing as a single massive star,\" Mark Krumholz told the Associated Press, \"could in fact be a binary system too close to be resolved.\"  Krumholz is an astronomer at the University of California.\nAnother astronomer, Phillip Massey from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, also warns that this may be the case. Massey explained that the star's weight had been inferred using scientific models that were subject to change.\nThe R136 star cluster, the star's location, is in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy about 165,000 light-years away. The Large Magellanic Cloud, located between the constellations Dorado and Mensa, is visible as a faint cloud in the southern hemisphere.

Doctorow called for a \"reframing\" of the digital rights slogan \"information wants to be free\". \"The most important thing\" about digital rights, he noted, \"has nothing to do with art.

John Buckman of Magnatune followed up Doctorow's comments, noting that DRM is \"unsustainable\" but that the public needed to \"pressure companies into\" open-source solutions.\nA keynote speech by James Boyle compared the current age to the age just before application of the theories of Adam Smith and other early capitalist economists began breaking down the entrenched monopolies of mercantilism. Boyle called on the audience to come up with a \"jaw droppingly simple\" idea for a reformed copyright system; he gave his speech in front of a projection of the twitterfall as audience members commented on his words.\nBoyle, like most of the conference, took a pro-reform but anti-piracy position, saying \"It is a tragedy that an entire generation has lost the notion that breaking the law is wrong\".

The only clue to the motivation of the murder was when he told police \"the world would be better with fewer people\" during interrogation.\nThe teenager attacked his mother, 42, and 12-year-old sister in their flat while his father was working at the family-owned restaurant situated across the road. After killing them, he fled the scene and called police at approximately 3:30 a.m. HKT (1930 UTC, July 21) from a telephone booth in a nearby park. As he was waiting for the police to arrive, he cut a wound in his own hand. When police found him, he was wearing black gloves and was covered in bloodstains, and carrying the chopper in his rucksack. They escorted him back to the family home and discovered his mother and sister's bodies which were inflicted with extensive knife wounds to their necks and abdomens. The boy's father temporarily shut down his restaurant as a result of the murder, and visited his son in hospital while he was receiving treatment for his hand laceration.\nThe boy, who studies at Po Leung Kuk Lee Shing Pik College, ranked first in class in Primary Six, and was known to be well behaved, friendly and hard-working. His principal, his father, an employee at the family's restaurant and a neighbour were said to be shocked at the news of the murders. The local newspaper vendor described him as \"polite\". There have been no record of any arguments among the family members; however, graffiti which is believed to have been written by the teenager was found on the walls of the block of flats where the boy lives. The graffiti includes foul language, including \"shit\" and \"bitch\", as well as \"I love you\" and \"Happy birthday (little sister)\".

The constitution of Haiti lays out six conditions for candidates:\nWhilst Jean is thought to meet most of these criteria, The Guardian reports that the rapper is \"understood to have US citizenship\", and that this would make him ineligible. This was denied by Jean's uncle Raymond Joseph, who is also Haitian Ambassador to the United States.\n\"He is not a US citizen and has never been,\" Joseph told the Christian Science Monitor. The ambassador claimed that Jean had always remained a Haitian citizen.\nEven then, it is unclear whether Jean will qualify under the residence clause, having spent much of his life in the United States.

Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes.\nThe fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the Mojave Desert and San Gabriel Mountains. The first was a 30-acre fire that began to the west of Lancaster in the Fairmont area. It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first. The second fire, the \"Briggs Fire\", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway. It burned 500 acres south of the 14 Freeway, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's Station Fire. The third fire, the \"Crown Fire\", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near Acton. The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into Leona Valley and Palmdale.\nOver 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop Phos-Chek slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters known as \"Firehawks\" are making water-drops. As well as LACFD, firefighters from Los Angeles City Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire. Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph. Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.\nThe fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers. Last night, the California Aqueduct acted as a barrier to the fire.\nResidents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations. Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased. However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale. Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California. 21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday.\nAt 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference.

The ceremony occurred in Rhinebeck, New York amidst a flurry of secrecy and speculation surrounding the event.\nNot much was known about the wedding, and those involved in the event did not say anything to the media. An estimated 500 guests were at the ceremony, which took place at Astor Courts, a large Beaux Arts estate built for John Jacob Astor IV over 100 years ago. The secluded mansion is situated on 50 acres (20.2 hectares) of land in the small town of Rhinebeck. A no-fly zone was established over the estate.\nThe guest list was the subject of much speculation, but notable figures Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and John Major reportedly did not attend the festivities. Madeleine Albright, Steve Bing, Warren Buffet, and Kobe Bryant were rumored to have been seen at the wedding.\nThe marriage ceremony was led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Reverend William Shillady. Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, wore a tallit (prayer shawl) and a yarmulke. Clinton is a Methodist. A Clinton family friend read the poem \"The Life That I Have\", by Leo Marks. Chelsea Clinton wore a strapless dress designed by Vera Wang. She had been spotted by Women's Wear Daily at Wang's New York showroom earlier last week, and Wang was reportedly seen in Rhinebeck as well.\nThe town of Rhinebeck was the subject of much public interest on Saturday. Photographers, journalists, and ordinary citizens lined the streets to get a peek at the celebrities attending the wedding. Many stores had signs saying something similar to \"Congratulations Marc & Chelsea.\" Residents temporarily displaced by the wedding were even given bottles of wine for the inconvenience.\n30-year-old Chelsea Clinton and 32-year-old Marc Mezvinsky first met in Washington, D.C. while teenagers, and both later attended Stanford University. Now living in New York, Mezvinsky works at G3 Capital as an investment banker, while Clinton recently earned her master's degree in public health at Columbia University. Mezvinsky is the son of the now-divorced Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Ed Mezvinsky, friends of the Clinton family.\nAlthough thought to cost several million dollars, a Clinton family friend claimed that the event would carry a price tag of less than US$1 million."}

Caliendo is a junior minister for justice accused of involvement in a secret cabal that reportedly tried to influence judical and government appointments. His resignation was called for by the opposition but, crucially, it was the abstention of 75 members of the senate, Gianfranco Fini's rebels, that led to the motion being defeated.\nThe abstention averted a confrontation between the coalition and the rebels but it can also be seen as a show of strength by the renegades, a way of showing their powerful influence while avoiding a dispute.\nAlthough superficially the motion's rejection appears to show that the coalition government can still be effective without a majority, The Telegraph's website commented that it demonstrates that Fini's rebels are now in a position to control the outcome of votes in the house, since their support or their abstention can mean the difference between a motion passing or being rejected.\nThe motion's defeat also means that the early elections that looked to be on the horizon may be put off. The elections could have been called early due to the rupture in the party but now may be postponed until later this year. Berlusconi's closest ally Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League party, said: \"This means that we are resisting and that we will not go to the polls for now.\" However Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, also of the Northern League party, said yesterday that elections later this year could not be ruled out.\nThe alleged influence-peddling that junior minister Caliendo is accused of is the same kind of moral and legal issue that has dogged Berlusconi's government, and the kind of issue that led Fini to lead the break away from the coalition. The Prime Minister may be facing impeachment after Italy's Constitutional Court overturned a law granting him immunity from prosecution.

However, there was no evidence of an explosion and none of the surrounding houses were damaged. Three young children, two boys and a girl, were found to have died at the scene. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious.\nA woman, believed to be the children's mother, was found injured on the ground in front of the house and there are reports that witnesses saw her jump from a third floor balcony. She was taken for treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.\nIn a statement the Lothian and Borders Police said: \"The investigation into the cause of this tragedy is in its early stages.\" However, the police have also said that there was no fault with the gas supply.\nPost-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on the children's bodies.  Police said no identities would be released until these were completed.\nA police spokesperson said: \"A criminal investigation is currently under way and nothing more can be said at this time into the circumstances which led to their deaths.\"\nThe mother of the three children, now named as eight year olds Gianluca and Augustino and five year old Cecilia Riggi, is to be questioned by police after details emerged that suggest it is unlikely the children died in the fire.\nNeighbours have reported that they heard screaming from inside the house and one source said that when they found the victims lying dead in the living room it was \"a horrific scene.\" However reports that the children died before the fire broke out have not been confirmed by official sources and only reports by neighbours and others at the scene have indicated this. \nPolice refused to confirm reports that the children had died before the fire broke out, and say that the results of the post-mortems would help them decide whether to launch a murder inquiry into the incident.\nAccording to Detective Superintendent Allan Jones the mother, Theresa Riggi, and her three children had been living in Edinburgh for little over a month since they were reported missing from their home in Skene, Aberdeenshire last month. Mrs Riggi is currently in a stable condition in hospital and Det Supt Jones said they are hoping to speak to her on Thursday. He said: \"She's not in a position to speak to us at the moment.\"\nThe children were reportedly at the centre of a custody battle between Mrs Riggi and the children's father, Pasquale Riggi. He has been informed and is helping police to determine the last movements of the family. He is not a suspect in the investigation. Det Supt Jones reported: \"He's heartbroken but he's very composed. He realizes he holds a lot of central information that we need. We're conscious of the trauma he's gone through.\"\nTheresa Riggi and her husband were going through divorce proceedings and she was due to appear at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday. She apparently did not attend the hearing. At that time the judge was told that her whereabouts were once again unknown.\nThe Judge, Lady Clark, granted a search warrant for Mrs Riggi and said that social workers should supervise the children, applying for child protection orders if necessary, after Mr Riggi's counsel asked for an order to safeguard the children's interests.\nThe children were allegedly educated at home so the Social Work Department had had no contact with the family since they moved to Scotland from the US.\nIt is believed that Mrs Riggi may have turned on the gas, and that a neighbour smelled the fumes and called the emergency services, which may have led to the original report of a gas explosion.\nTributes of flowers have been left close to the scene with cards of sympathy and condolences.\nLothian and Borders Police have released a statement confirming that the post mortems of Gianluca, Augustino and Cecilia have been concluded. Following this statement a warrant was issued and Theresa Riggi was charged with murder.\nA spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: \"A 46-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with murder in connection with the petition warrant which was granted earlier today,\"\n\"Due to the medical condition of the accused, it is not at this time known when she will appear in court.\"\nIn an earlier statement Mr. Riggi released a statement saying: \"Our family is struggling to come to terms with the immense and tragic loss of three beautiful children.\n'Thanks to all who have offered such great comfort and support.\n'We request that the media respect our privacy at this difficult time.\""}

However, Medical Rescue International later stated in a post on Facebook that no airplane had crashed and it had \"joined up with other services to attend to a mock accident at Harare International Airport ... Good to keep the practising up.\" \nThose behind the staged accident had reportedly not told any other governmental departments, resulting in relatives inquiring with Air Zimbabwe as to what had happened. A senior figure for Air Zimbabwe stated that he was \"concerned that this incident led to many, many calls to us. People were frightened. No actual plane was involved, but there was a scenario involving a Boeing 767 plane that had been hijacked and forced down at Harare airport.\"\nIt was reported that Peter Chikumba, chief of Air Zimbabwe, had also not been informed that the exercise was to take place, and that the airline had set up an emergency helpdesk to liaise with the families of victims. Alan McGuinness, a correspondent for Sky News, stated, \"journalists who arrived at the airport saw smoke rising from a runway and were then taken to a room where they were told to wait. David Chawota, the head of the Zimbabwe Civil Aviation Authority, said the media was duped to make the drill more realistic.\" Chawota stated, \"telling the media was part of the exercise. We wanted to see how the media would react,\" he said. \nChawota himself told BNO News that an airliner had crashed. Michael van Poppel, head of BNO News said that \"while I first thought Chawota was just misinformed by others, although that would be odd since he is the CEO of the aviation authority, I was stunned to hear that he actually knew it was a drill and wanted to see the media's response ... This basically means he was lying to me when I spoke to him, but also to other reporters he spoke to ...

The floods have been confirmed as the worst in eighty years.\nHeavy monsoon rains led to the flooding of the huge Indus River, destroying homes in the north of the country and causing a large amount of damage in the north-west frontier province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Manuel Bessler of the United Nations said: \"What we are facing now is a major catastrophe. We are afraid it will get worse.\nArmy and government forces have rushed to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from parts of the Punjab province of Pakistan, where the disaster spread to yesterday, and from Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend.\nThe flooding is now in its second week and the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, especially since in many parts of the country there is still torrential rain, with more forecast. In other parts of Pakistan the water has receded, but this leaves a layer of mud and slime and this covers very large areas. For those affected by the floods, disease is the biggest problem now. The insanitary conditions have already caused diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Cholera and other water-borne diseases may appear if sanitary conditions for those displaced by the calamity are not established. Medical supplies are desperately needed for doctors to keep a pandemic or epidemic of a water-borne disease from infecting the victims of the flooding.\nRelief has been hardest to provide in the north-west where many bridges and roads have been washed away. Whole towns have been cut off and this makes providing aid to those areas a very difficult task.\nAir force pilots have been volunteering to fly aid missions to badly hit areas, transporting medical supplies, clean water and food to where it is needed. The transport planes carry enough foodstuffs to feed one hundred families for a month. Motivation for the missions among pilots is very high, as is the tension in the transport planes as they fly at 36,000 feet over the flood-hit country. Only from the air is the full extent of the damage visible. Pilots have been flying the maximum number of hours allowed and pushing the limits of their endurance to give the victims of the flood food, water and everything they need to survive.\nMany foreign governments and aid agencies are contributing to the disaster relief effort. The U.S. Army has been flying relief missions, airlifting people from areas where they are stranded. The first mission involved four U.S. Chinook helicopters landing in the tourist town of Kalam in the Swat Valley, north-west Pakistan. The resort had been cut off for more than a week, according to a reporter there. The Chinooks flew hundreds of people to safer areas lower down. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said that 800 people had been evacuated and relief goods had been distributed.\nThe U.S. government pledged 10 million dollars in assistance following the first reports of the disaster. Yesterday the country promised a further 25 million dollars in aid. A spokesperson from the Embassy said: \"The U.S. is making a new contribution of 25 million dollars in assistance to flood-affected populations, bringing its total commitment to date to more than 35 million dollars.\" The money will go to international aid organisations and established Pakistani aid groups to provide food, health care and shelter to people displaced by the floods.\nMalaysia has also decided to contribute US$1 million for relief efforts in the form of humanitarian aid. The Foreign Ministry said the aid was a manifestation of the government and the people's concern and sympathy. \"The government of Malaysia hopes the contribution will help alleviate the suffering of flood victims in Pakistan.\"\nIn Britain, the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation representing 13 of the leading UK humanitarian agencies, has been coordinating relief efforts and has launched an emergency appeal for public donations to help the victims of the crisis. Charities and aid agencies have been quick to respond to the disaster, sending aid and response teams to the worst hit areas. Food, water, shelter and medical supplies have been provided but much more is needed. \nPatrick Fuller of the Red Cross (the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies), who has been based in the country for a few days, described the situation on the ground as \"desperate\" and said the worst hit areas are \"totally dependent\" on outside help. He said the Red Cross movement is working with local partners to get aid packages, containing cooking tools and shelter such as tents and blankets, to 35,000 families.\nThe Red Cross alone has distributed 10,000 food packs and 1000 tents across the affected areas so far. However, figures for the amount of aid distributed are constantly changing as this is an ongoing relief effort.\nFuller reported that in Nowshera, which is in the north-west of the country close to the Indus River, \"80% of homes have been badly damaged or destroyed, all the mud-brick houses have been washed away.\n\"In the most remote areas - where roads are cut off - donkeys are making eight-hour hikes to reach people.\n\"We are trying to move people into temporary camps - giving them timber, roofing sheets and basic shelter - but there is the added complication that many are reluctant to leave whatever homes they have left.\"\nThis has also been a problem in the south of the country in Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend. Evacuations have been going on to move people out of the path of the flood but many will not join the mass exodus and have chosen to brave the waters.\n\"Many people rely on open wells, which have been contaminated, so access to clean water is a problem. We are worried about communicable diseases, like respiratory infections, skin diseases, diarrhoea,\" Mr Fuller said.\nThe charity have been setting up mobile medical teams to better combat disease and infection.\nThough the relief effort at the moment is focused on the survival of those hit by the catastrophe, on those who \"had their lives swept away in seconds\", the relief effort is expected to last a full six months. \nThose who will be most affected in the long term by this disaster will be the poorest. They will have had everything washed away from them so they will have to start from scratch. Sadly, for those living in the poorest areas in the north and centre of Pakistan, the fight for survival is only just beginning and though they may feel they are enduring much at the moment, getting their lives back together after the first stages of this calamity are over is going to be even harder.\nThe Disasters Emergency Committee has said it has managed to give aid to 300,000 people so far. Many UK charities have been distributing food and medicine, as well as water purification tablets, cooking tools, shelter and hygiene kits. They have been using rafts, boats and donkeys. Brendan Gormley, chief executive of the DEC, said: \"These devastating floods have left millions fighting to survive with little food, clean water or shelter.\"\nThe DEC has appealed for donations from the public of the UK to help the victims of this crisis. The appeal is to allow the charities to continue relief work in the worst hit areas of the country.\nFollowing a television appeal by the DEC, 2.5 million was raised and this has enabled the 13 charities the committee represents to reach 300,000 people with emergency supplies.

The protest was held outside the International Convention Centre (ICC) venue in the British city, where the president addressed supporters of his Pakistan Peoples Party and leading figures of the Pakistani community. Al Jazeera reported that two shoes were thrown at Zardari as he delivered his address, by a man who reportedly managed to break through police barriers to make a personal protest against the President.\nPakistan is experiencing the worst flooding in eighty years and it has been reported that the floods have now hit 14 million people. The president has faced criticism for continuing his tour during the crisis and though the messages of the protesters were many and varied, shown by placards ranging from \"Save Pakistan from American terror and Zardari\" to \"Stop killing innocent Christians, repeal blasphemy law 295 B and 295 A\", Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher said \"[the] one thing they all agree on is that he should not be here.\"\nInside the ICC, speaking to a group of supporters, Mr Zardari said the trip had been crucial in raising more than 20 million in aid from Britain and France and for resolving the diplomatic rift between Pakistan and Britain, caused by British Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about alleged Pakistani terror links. David Cameron said on July 28 that \"we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and...promote the export of terror\". The Pakistani President has said that his European tour is essential to mend the diplomatic rift these comments have caused.\nThe President's son has also defended the tour, saying \"He's doing the best he can and what he thinks is best to help the people of Pakistan.\" He added that \"his personal presence in Pakistan would not be able to raise this much money.\" \nThe Financial Times said the President \"struggled at times to be heard above the chanting of hundreds of supporters.\" The chanting from the protesters arrayed outside the ICC could also be heard from where the President gave his speech. Many were calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.\nAccording to the Associated Press of Pakistan the President's trip has been kept as cheap as possible, with Mr Zardari staying in the \"cheapest five-star hotel in Central London\" while he met with Mr Cameron. But at today's protest many held placards decrying the fact that while money was urgently needed in Pakistan the President was taking a tour that would cost the country. Two examples of such placards were: \"Thousands dying president is holidaying\" and \"while Pakistan floods Zadradi enjoys\".\nThe demonstration was held in the shadow of the Hyatt Regency Hotel where Mr Zardari has been staying. It is one of the most expensive hotels in Birmingham but the raised bridge that links directly to the ICC does provide the best security for the President. \nMohammed Khalil, a local official from the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, told the AFP that \"He should be there organising for his own people. Instead he's here with so many people. The government is paying all the expense for that. That money should be spent on the people of Pakistan, not on himself.\" However the President's son said millions had been raised from Britain and France because of the tour, and that the President would return once worldwide attention had died down.\nThe protest itself carried on for many hours, from before 2:00 in the afternoon until 4:25, when it ended with a prayer ceremony. The protest reflected the prominence of the Islamic faith in Pakistani culture, with a tarpaulin stretched on the ground to allow for Muslim prayer. National feeling was strong, shown by the numerous Pakistani flags being flown, and the presence of the closing religious ceremony and Islamic prayer mirrors the close-knit relationship nationalist and religious feeling have in Pakistan."}

Obama also said that Kagan would have a positive impact on the conservative-majority court because she \"understands that the law isnt just an abstraction or an intellectual exercise\" and that \"she knows that the Supreme Courts decisions shape not just the character of our democracy, but the circumstances of our daily lives.\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (Democrat-Vermont) also said that Kagan's confirmation was \"long, long overdue.\"\nKagan is a former dean of the Harvard Law School, a legal adviser during the Clinton administration, and the US Solicitor General in the current Obama administration. She becomes the fourth woman ever to serve on the court and will become the third current female justice, joining Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Sotomayor was also appointed by Obama and confirmed by the Senate by a 6831 vote. Kagan replaces retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, who is the leading liberal on the court."}

Since June, temperatures in the country have been rising, and Moscow was expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.78 degrees Celsius) on Friday, about 25 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) above the normal temperature for this time of the year.\nThe environmental protection agency of Russia's capital has already stated that {w|carbon monoxide}} levels in the city's air were five times as high as safe levels and that particulate pollution levels were three times as high as safe levels.\nThe dense smoke also caused chaos at Moscow airports. Visibility at Domodedovo Airport was reportedly around 400 yards (365.76 metres) on Friday, and many flights were either delayed or arrived late.\nAt Russia's Alabinsk military base, located around 45 miles (72.42 kilometres) southwest of Moscow, artillery rockets were moved to a location where they would not be threatened by the fires, said Russia's Ministry of Defence. The fires also burned close to a nuclear missile warning site near Moscow, but a spokesperson for the Russian Space Forces said that the warning center's fire brigades had extinguished two fires in the area. Previously, materials from a nuclear research center in Sarov were moved out of the way of fires to avoid a possible explosion occurring.\nRussian officials have received criticism over their handling of the blazes. Last week, Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, dismissed five military officers for letting a fire burn hangars at an air base near Moscow. One of Medvedev's aides said on Friday that mayors will be debriefed and that those who did not adequately respond to the wildfires \"will be brought to justice.\" Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said last week that local officials not dealing with the fires should resign.\nThe spree of wildfires has left at least 3,000 people without homes. Seven regions are now under a state of emergency, and 28 more are under a state of emergency for farmers with crops failing in the heat.\nFire crews from other nations in both Europe and Asia were arriving to help fight the fires, and a shelter was set up in Kaliningrad to support 150 children from central Russia who were displaced by the crisis."}

Nineteen people were killed on Tuesday in revenge killings, bringing the death toll to 49 over two days. Twenty-five shops and a number of vehicles including trucks and buses were burned in a series of arson attacks across the city.\nHaider was gunned down while attending a funeral near the centre of the city. An officer at the Nazimabad police station said \"[t]he number of attackers and the mode of their transport are not clear, but initial investigations suggest that there were more than two people who came on a motorcycle and they were probably backed by armed men in a car. They first shot at the legislators guard Khalid Khan and then entered the mosque and fired at Mr Haider who was in the ablution room.\"\nFollowing the first night of revenge attacks and arson the MQM accused its main political rival, the Awami National Party (ANP), of supporting the Islamist militants suspected of the assassination. The MQM is a coalition partner with the ANP in the national government and is known as a party that holds great potential for mass mobilization in the province of Sindh.\nThe Associated Press (AP) said that the MQM's accusation \"appeared to reflect the complex and vicious political and ethnic fault lines that crisscross Karachi.\"  \nThe AP also said that Sharfuddin Memon, the head of the Citizen's Police Liason Committee had speculated that Haider's killing may be related to a government operation against \"land mafias\", who illegally occupy commercially valuable land. According to the AP's report it is alleged that some of these mafias have the backing of political parties.  \nAccording to human rights organizations there have been more than 300 political killings in Karachi this year. \nBy Tuesday evening the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre had received 17 dead bodies and 55 injured. The head of the hospital, Dr Seemi Jamali, said that they had transfused 200 blood units to victims of targeted violence and that 31 gunshot victims had been operated upon that day.\nThis week's wave of violence and attacks began with the assassination of Raza Haider, but due to the nature of Karachi politics the exact motive behind Haider's murder is unclear. The Associated Press commented that the city has long been plagued by political violence between supporters of rival parties \"that draw votes from different ethnic groups in the city of 16 million people.\" The publication said this muddied the reasons for the bloodshed.\nRehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister was quoted by media as saying Islamist militants were likely suspects. He said that Haider had been on the extremist hit list. The BBC reported that they had been told by security officials in Karachi that there is evidence to suggest the assassination was carried out by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Pakistan's deadliest militant group.\nThe BBC News website also reported that senior MQM leader Babar Ghauri had said: \"Every MQM activist will now be looking to pay back the people involved in this heinous act\".\nRaza Haider was laid to rest on Tuesday at the Martyr's Graveyard in Azizabad, northern Karachi. Hundreds of MQM members and supporters attended to pay their final respects to Haider and to his guard Khalid Khan, also killed in the shooting.

The private sector added just 71,000 jobs during July, also less than the 90,000 economists predicted.

Including the Census workers, the government laid off 202,000 people at federal, state, and local levels.\nThough the unemployment rate remained at 9.5%, many discouraged job-seekers have given up looking for a position. Those who have given up are not counted as unemployed. The workforce participation rate, which counts those people as not participating in the workforce, dropped to 64.6% from 64.7% in June. The underemployment rate, which counts part-time laborers looking for a full-time job and those discouraged workers, was flat at 16.5% from June. \nThe Labor Department also revised their job report for June.

Papermaster did not comment on the situation.\nAccording to The New York Times, who first broke the news about Papermaster's departure, an anonymous individual \"with direct knowledge of the situation\" claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues, some related to the iPod Touch.\nWhen Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4, he praised the device's antenna design. However, many consumers reported that, when holding the phone in a certain location, reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls. Apple's response to the issue, dubbed \"Antennagate\" by the media, was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location. They later found a related software glitch that caused the signal strength to be misreported on the device. In a July 16 press conference, Jobs said that all iPhone 4 buyers would be eligible to receive a free case, or \"bumper,\" which alleviates the signal problem.\nCiting people familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal reported that Papermaster had been pushed out due to an incompatibility with Apple's corporate culture. The sources claimed that Papermaster was not used to the environment or corporate politics and did not possess the creativity the company wanted to see.

Mansfield was already involved in iPhone development, overseeing processor and display engineering.\nPapermaster had been with Apple since November 2008, but a United States federal judge barred him from working until April 2009.

Judt's first two marriages both ended in a divorce.\nTony Robert Judt, a secular Jew, was born on January 2, 1948 in London, but spent much of his adult life in the United States. The descendant of Marxist Lithuanian rabbis, he was sent to a camp in Israel as a teenager, and became a Zionist. Later, he spoke at a Zionist convention in Paris and worked as a translator for the Israel Defense Forces in 1967, starting with the Six-Day War.\nAn alumnus of King's College, he began teaching at NYU as Professor of European studies in 1987. Judt had previously taught at Cambridge, the University of California, and Oxford University.\nJudt, also an author, became a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his 2005 book Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945. The almost 900-page book covers the history of the development of Europe after World War II. He also wrote about topics such as the fall of Marxism and Communism.\nIn September 2008, Judt was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. One form of motor neurone disease, ALS targets nerve cells and causes a loss of speech and movement abilities. Left paralyzed and unable to breathe without assistance, Judt continued to lecture. Earlier this year, Judt was able to write a group of personal essays for The New York Review of Books, in which he discussed the disease. \"In contrast to almost every other serious or deadly disease, one is thus left free to contemplate at leisure and in minimal discomfort the catastrophic progress of one's own deterioration,\" he wrote. In 2009, Judt was the recipient of a special Orwell Prize, given to him for \"intelligence, insight and conspicuous courage.\"\nJudt's later views on Israel differed from those he had held as a teenager. In 1983, he called Israel a \"belligerently intolerant, faith-driven ethno state,\" opposing a two-state solution. Earlier this year, he wrote, \"most Israelis were not transplanted latter-day agrarian socialists but young, prejudiced urban Jews who differed from their European or American counterparts chiefly in their macho, swaggering self-confidence, and access to armed weapons.\" His stance on the topic was the subject of much controversy, even leading to his removal from the editorial committee for The New Republic."}

{"id": 1233, "ended": true, "text": "Vinay Deolalikar, a mathematician who works for HP Labs, claims to have proven that P is not equal to NP.  The problem is the greatest unsolved problem in theoretical computer science and is one of seven problems in which the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered million dollar prizes to the solutions.\nThe question of whether P equals NP essentially asks whether there exist problems which take a long time to solve but whose solutions can be checked quickly.  More formally, a problem is said to be in P if there is a program for a Turing machine, an ideal theoretical computer with unbounded amounts of memory, such that running instances of the problem through the program will always answer the question in polynomial time  time always bounded by some fixed polynomial power of the length of the input.  A problem is said to be in NP, if the problem can be solved in polynomial time when instead of being run on a Turing machine, it is run on a non-deterministic Turing machine, which is like a Turing machine but is able to make copies of itself to try different approaches to the problem simultaneously. \nMathematicians have long believed that P does not equal NP, and the question has many practical implications. Much of modern cryptography, such as the RSA algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, rests on certain problems, such as factoring integers, being in NP and not in P. If it turned out that P=NP, these methods would not work but many now difficult problems would likely be easy to solve. If P does not equal NP then many natural, practical problems such as the traveling salesman problem are intrinsically difficult. \nIn 2000, the Clay Foundation listed the \"Clay Millenium Problems,\" seven mathematical problems each of which they would offer a million dollars for a correct solution. One of these problems was whether P equaled NP. Another of these\nseven, the Poincar conjecture, was solved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman who first made headlines for solving the problem and then made them again months later for refusing to take the prize money. \nOn August 7, mathematician Greg Baker noted on his blog that he had seen a draft of a claimed proof by Deolalikar although among experts a draft had apparently been circulating for a few days.  Deolalikar's proof works by connecting certain ideas in computer science and finite model theory to ideas in statistical mechanics.  The proof works by showing that if certain problems known to be in NP were also in P then those problems would have impossible statistical properties.  Computer scientists and mathematicians have expressed a variety of opinions about Deolalikar's proof, ranging from guarded optimism to near certainty that the proof is incorrect.  Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has expressed his pessimism by stating that he will give $200,000 of his own money to Deolalikar if the proof turns out to be valid.  Others have raised specific technical issues with the proof but noted that the proof attempt presented interesting new techniques that might be relevant to computer science whether or not the proof turns out to be correct.  Richard Lipton, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech, has said that \"the author certainly shows awareness of the relevant obstacles and command of literature supporting his arguments.\"  Lipton has listed four central objections to the proof, none of which are necessarily fatal but may require more work to address.  On August 11, 2010, Lipton reported that consensus of the reviewers was best summarized by mathematician Terence Tao, who expressed the view that Deolalikar's paper probably did not give a proof that P!=NP even after major changes, unless substantial new ideas are added."}

He was serving a minimum sentence of seven years for sixteen sex offences against a child, including four rapes.

S. Guralnik at Brown University,  C. R. Hagen of the University of Rochester, and Tom Kibble at Imperial College London.\nThree papers written in 1964 explained what is now known as the \"Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism\" (or Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson for short).  The mechanism is the key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the Standard model of particle physics.  The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in Physical Review Letters in 1964 and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRLs 50th anniversary celebration. \n\"There are six people who developed the mechanism in quick succession and who hold a legitimate claim to credit for it,\" says particle physicist Frank Close at the University of Oxford, UK.  Because the Swedish Royal Academy of Science can award Nobel prizes to no more than three people, this puts six men aiming for half as many Nobel medals, should the particle be found.  The Nobel committee can award the prize to groups and associations.\nFermilab's Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are searching for a particle that will constitute evidence for this significant discovery.  Recent progress has given a new urgency not only to the race to find the particle, but also to establishing authorship of the ideas behind it. As John Ellis, a particle physicist based at CERN, acknowledges: \"Let's face it, a Nobel Prize is at stake.\" \nThe issue over credit and authorship was highlighted late July in France when the American and British team of Guralnik,  Hagen, and Kibble were omitted from the conference overview web site.  Several groups threatened to boycott and raised the issue in discussions of the theory behind the on-going search for the particle.  One of the meeting's organizers, Gregorio Bernardi at the Laboratory of Nuclear and High Energy Physics in Paris, admits that the committee was surprised by the strength of objections leveled at the web advertisement and the committee. \"People took this very seriously, which we didn't expect,\" he says.\nPhysicist Tom Ferbel said the snub by the French conference organizers was \"insulting\" and \"chilling\", noting that the American Physical Society awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics to all six physicists for this theory.  \"I do fear,\" he said, \"that the myopic views of the organizers could definitely impact the decisions of the Swedish Academy.\"\nThe conference organizers acknowledged that their choice was controversial by inviting a special talk on the tangled history of the mechanism, providing a forum for disgruntled conference participants to debate the matter. However, although the meeting ultimately ran smoothly, it seems likely that arguments over this issue will become more heated now that the Higgs particle is perceived to be within reach. As John Ellis states, \"I'm just glad that I'm not on the Nobel committee deciding who to throw out of the lifeboat.\""}

Rostenkowski attended St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Wisconsin, served with the US Army in Korea, and graduated from Loyola University in 1951.\nRostenkowski's political career was supported by the Cook County political machine, and he became a member of the Illinois state legislature in 1952, one year after graduating from college. In 1958, when he was 30, Rostenkowski was elected to the US House of Representatives. In 1961, he began serving on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, the chief committee of the House for writing taxes. From 19811994, he served as the committee's chairman. Rostenkowski was involved in the creation of Medicare in 1966 and he helped make amendments to the Social Security system in 1983.\nIn 1992, a federal jury began an inquiry into the House post office, and Rostenkowski was accused of buying US$22,000 in stamps with government funds and then turning them into cash. The investigation, which lasted two years, led to Republican allegations of corruption within the Democratic party. In 1994, Rostenkowski was charged with 17 felony counts, including the use of federal money to purchase furniture, and obstruction of justice. In order to avoid a trial, Rostenkowski made a deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to two counts of mail fraud in exchange for fifteen months in prison, two months in a halfway house, and a US$100,000 fine.\nRostenkowski, who was not reelected for a nineteenth term in Congress in 1994, continued to maintain his innocence, and was pardoned by US President Bill Clinton in 2000."}

Assange had this morning said that he was going to hand himself in to police but also said that the accusations against him were false. The investigation is continuing.\nA warrant for Assange's arrest was issued on Friday evening after the Stockholm police informed prosecutors that he had been accused of rape. According to Expressen's sources two women between 20 and 30 years old are the alleged victims.  Police and prosecutor Maria Hljebo Kjellstrand told Swedish news agency TT that the alleged molestation took place in Stockholm on the night of 1314 August and the alleged rape happened \"later\" in Enkping.

Sources told Expressen that the two women knew each other and \"knew that they had been the victims of the same thing\". A source says that the women were afraid of Assange's \"position of power\" and had been reluctant to make a formal report to the police. However, on Sunday one of his accusers was interviewed by Aftonbladet and denied that they were scared of Assange: \"It is wrong to say that we were frightened of Assange and that we hadn't wanted to report him for that reason.

These scarps were found all over the moon and appear to be minimally weathered, indicating that the geologic events that created them were fairly recent.

It is the first time ants have been found using more than one antibiotic in combination.  The new antibiotics discovered have anti-fungal effect, and can be useful for modern medicine. UK Medical Research Council funded the investigation.\nAcromyrmex octospinosus leaf cutter ants form the biggest known animal colonies, reaching several million individuals.  They are native to South and Central America, but are now found in the southern United States as well.  They are known to grow fungi gardens, and this is why the researchers looked into the interaction of ants and fungi.  The scientists collected them from three colonies in Trinidad and Tobago.  UEA professor Dr Matt Hutchings explained, \"This was really a fun project which started with a PhD student, Joerg Barke, streaking leaf-cutting ants onto agar plates to isolate antibiotic producing bacteria.\"\nThe health of a certain type of fungus gardens is vital for the ants colony since the fungus is used to feed larvae and the queen. The antibiotics act both as herbicides and regulators of fungus growth. The antibiotics are produced by actinomycete bacteria, which live in a state of symbiosis with the ants, and are found on the bodies of the ants themselves. The symbiotic relationships benefit both the ants and the bacteria.\nAs a result of the study, a new antibiotic has also been discovered.  It's related to nystatin, one of the antifungals used in modern medicine.  The researchers expect to discover more new antibiotics and are optimistic about their use in medicine.  Dr Matt Hutchings who was leading the research said, \"It's also very exciting that ants not only evolved agriculture before humans but also combination therapy with natural antibiotics.

{"id": 1295, "ended": true, "text": "A University of Tokyo group of researchers, led by bioengineer Shoji Takeuchi, has made an electronic sensor capable of smelling gases. The sensor uses genetically engineered frog cells. Since previous sensors were not very accurate, the scientist decided to try a biological approach. The invention was revealed in a US scientific journal yesterday, and is supposed to be used to design better machines to detect polluting gases in the atmosphere.\nPrevious smell sensors were based on quartz rods, which vibrate when a substance binds to them. The gases are distinguished by their molar masses, which can be similar for molecules with different structure, thus relatively often triggering a false positive. Trying to find a more accurate solution, Takeuchi decided to follow an example from insect world. As he explained, \"when you think about the mosquito, it is able to find people because of carbon dioxide from the human. So the mosquito has CO2 receptors. When we can (extract) DNA (from the mosquito) we can put this DNA into the frog eggs to detect CO2.\"\nGenes of several insects (the silk moth, diamondback moth and fruit fly), injected into African clawed frog Xenopus laevis eggs, allowed them to produce relatively inexpensive and useful sensors. The choice of the species was caused by their widely studied and well-understood protein expression mechanism.\nThe modified cells responded to three kinds of pheromones and one odourant, which have similar chemical properties. When a molecule of an odorous substance adhered to the receptor on the membrane protein, ion channels opened for a certain period of time, and a current was generated. Its magnitude was clearly different for all four tested substances, allowing to distinguish between them accurately.\nThe colleagues embedded the sensor into a mannequin, so that it could shake its head when a gas was detected. It was easier to observe. Pheromones and molecules with quite similar molecule structure produced clearly distinguishable reaction, with higher accuracy than other biological or human-made sensors. As the research group said, the detection sensitivity of the odor sensor is several tens of parts per billion (ppb), and it is as high as the sensitivity of an existing odor sensor that uses an oxide semiconductor. The distinctive feature of the new sensor is its capability to selectively detect some odorous substances, rather than its sensitivity. Very few false positives were possible due to the biological mechanism involved.\nAt normal temperature, the sensor lifetime is about 12 hours, which can be extended by putting it into a refrigerator before first use.\nShoji Takeuchi says has a great hope for research use in future, since the frog eggs are very practical for genetic engineering, and can be conveniently used to develop smell sensors for a wide range of gases. He said, \"The X. laevis oocyte has high versatility for the development of chemical sensors for various odorants. We believe that a shared ability to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot. .. The research will have wide implications... If the sensor is embedded in a nursing robot, it will be able to identify certain mouth odors or body odors. Also, it can be used for detecting CO2, air pollution, water pollution and food. It's very important for the environment.\""}

{"id": 1297, "ended": true, "text": "Ian Baldwin, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, and colleagues have discovered a multi-step protective mechanism of tobacco plants against Manduca sexta  caterpillars. In response to a chemical in the caterpillars' larvae, the plants release an odorous substance into air to attract  another species of insects, called \"big-eyed bugs\" (Geocoris). These carnivores come to the scene and attack the caterpillars. The response is triggered within 24 hours, which is a relatively short period of time. The discovery occurred as a result of field studies in a nature preserve in southwestern Utah.\nThe phenomenon starts with the recognition of the caterpillars by the plant. As a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology Silke Allmann explained, \"The plant cannot see its attacker, but plants can sense the digestive substances that attacking larvae have in their oral secretions when these substances come into contact with the leaves.\" To test that, the scientists coated some of caterpillars' eggs on two groups of tobacco plants and glued them. On one of the groups, the glue was mixed with caterpillars' split. The latter got more attention of the attackers, getting 25% of eggs destroyed against 8% for the other group.\nAllmann supposed that \"The simplest assumption is that the larval oral secretions contain a special enzyme, probably an isomerase, which rearranges the Z:E ratio of the aldehyde in favor of (E)-2-hexenal.\" The researchers heated the oral secretion to destroy the enzyme,  and applied it to wounded leaves. No plant response related to the studied process was observed, confirming the hypothesis.\n(E)-2-hexenal is a strong antibiotic agent. The food consumed by a caterpillar typically includes hundreds of microorganisms together with leaf tissue, which are mostly unneeded and killed by the above-mentioned substance quickly. Because of this important role of this substance, the caterpillars can't change their metabolism easily enough to prevent the subsequent events from happening.\nTo find out what happens after a caterpillar's presence is noted by the plant, Silke Allmann, a graduate student in Baldwin's group, examined the green leafy volatiles (GLVs), the substances responsible for the smell of fresh-cut plant parts. These substances are released into air if a plant is damaged. As the study released, the tobacco plant GLVs typically have a major share of Z isomers with very small amount of E isomers present. But the shares are distributed equally during a caterpillar attack. In a study with varying amount of different isomers present, E isomers turned out to be the ones attracting the predators to come to the scene and to attack the caterpillars.\nWhat is surprising, Silke Allmann found that the caterpillars are the direct stimulus of this change: caterpillar saliva converts the Z-isomers of the GLV molecules to E-isomers.  Prof. Ian Baldwin commented, \"That's where it got really weird. Why would a caterpillar do this to itself?\" He suggested that the E-GLVs could have anti-biotic effect in the caterpillar's digestive system.\nThe speed of the triggered reaction is relatively fast, it taking about one hour for the GLV isomers ratio change, and about 24 hours for the predators to be attracted by the substance released into the air. As Prof. Ian Baldwin, who was leading the research, said, \"Other indirect defense mechanisms of plants require the activation of new metabolic pathways for the release of odorant signals, and these responses are much slower.\"\nThe multi-step intricate approach involved is attracting the attention of scientists, who are looking forward to its application in agriculture. Baldwin noted that \"in effect, the caterpillar calls the police on itself\", and suggested to genetically modify crops to release similar signals to defend themselves against pests."}

The restructuring is, apparently, designed to get teachers back into the classroom. \nDuring the week, staff, students, alumni and parents had accused the headmaster of being dishonest and not \"tak[ing] a single question\" on the issue.\nAt 10am there were 21 teachers with big question marks over their employment but by 1pm they had the assurance they would be able to apply for new positions before external applicants, union secretary Terry Burke said. Mr Fairbairn said it was clearly the schools preference to continue the employment of existing staff. It is our view the existing staff are more than capable of taking on the new positions.\nSunshine Coast Grammar is a private Christian school approximately 95 km (60 miles) north of the state capital, Brisbane.\nTeachers at Sunshine Coast Grammar school have told the Sunshine Coast Daily that they received no warning of any pending redundancies. Independent Education Union of Australia representative and school careers counselor Maria Campanini said \"teacher morale is very low and people are very disappointed and disillusioned\".\nMs Campanini said that staff were saddened by the handling of the situation by headmaster Nigel Fairbairn. We got an email announcing a meeting and I thought it would just provide some feedback about the review, Ms Campanini said. But the 21 teachers whose jobs were directly affected were herded into a room, Mr Fairbairn read out a prepared statement, turned on his heel and left. He didnt take a single question. We were just left sitting there in shock.\nAn anonymous staff member told the Sunshine Coast Daily that,  Some teachers, who rely on the income and whose positions were abolished, were very distraught and they had to go to class. It appears were not valued in the school community, not to be even asked our opinion as to what might be the best outcome, to try and make it work.\nAccording to Ms Campanini, one of the teachers being made redundant is 30 weeks pregnant with another returning to work after maternity leave. Its really stressful for all the people involved, Ms Campanini said. People can understand the need for restructure when its explained, but were none the wiser.\nWhen it all happened on Friday, it was morning tea time and a lot of us had to go back in the classroom and teach all afternoon,\" the anonymous staff member said.\nParents have accused Fairbairn of constantly changing his version of events, with one telling the Sunshine Coast Daily that, The school board does not have independent parents on the board, which makes no sense at all. From what I have gathered, Mr Fairbairn is not interested in having parents involved in the decision-making processes.\nMr Fairbairn is trying to go into damage control and his story keeps changing, said Julie Hopkins, another Grammar parent. Hes told parents this restructure was not financially motivated but has told teachers the complete opposite thing. This is it. The gloves are off.\nWikinews obtained a list of middle management staff allegedly made redundant, or laid off due to restructuring, by the Queensland, Australia school. Sources say that those staff have been told that they can apply for new positions that have opened up.\nThe list, published on the SCGS alumni Facebook page, contains the names of twenty-two staff members. Seventeen positions are reportedly being opened up, eight of which seem to significantly overlap the old ones.\nThe changes are, apparently, designed to get teachers back into the classroom. We are not cutting subject choices and extracurricular activities, but retaining a student-driven curriculum that integrates with the new Australian Curriculum, in keeping with our commitment to teaching and learning opportunities, said headmaster Nigel Fairbairn.\nWikinews understands that Fairbairn attracted criticism when he was a head teacher in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a former student claimed that Fairbairn replaced the open and welcoming culture ... with the tyrannical and oppressive one. Fairbairn refused to comment on the criticism.\nFairbairn's statement came under attack from 2009 graduates who, in a open letter posted on Facebook, said, \"It is also hugely hypocritical to attack these teachers for not spending enough time in the classroom, when from firsthand experience the only time Mr. Nigel Fairbairn was ever sighted was during assembly (which he mysteriously stopped attending), never mind in the classroom, therefore, it is honestly astounding that he could make such unjust and incorrect statements.\"\nThey also expressed embarrassment \"to be associated with the name 'Sunshine Coast Grammar School' while you are at the head of the great community which Grammar once was.\"\nFour of the affected teachers were the backbone of the school when [controversy surrounded founding headmaster John Burgess] happened, a former prefect (student leader) said. They got it through that crisis and this is the thanks they get.\nPeople are angry and shocked, they continued. I am aware of at least 10 families who have said they will pull their children out of the school  it's that bad.\nThe student body has not ruled out protesting the schools plans.

Last year saw the release of the iPod Nano 5th generation, bringing a video camera and a large range of colours to the Nano for the first time. But as Apple again prepares to unveil a redesigned product, the company has released their quarterly sales figuresand revealed that they have sold only 9m iPods for the quarter to Junethe lowest number of sales since 2006, leading industry anylists to ponder whether the world's most successful music device is in decline.\nSuch a drop in sales is not a problem for Apple, since the iPhone 4 and the iPad are selling in high numbers. But the number of people buying digital music players are concerning the music industry. Charles Arthur, technology editor of The Guardian, wrote that the decline in sales of MP3 players was a \"problem\" for record companies, saying that \"digital music sales are only growing as fast as those of Apple's devices  and as the stand-alone digital music player starts to die off, people may lose interest in buying songs from digital stores. The music industry had looked to the iPod to drive people to buy music in download form, whether from Apple's iTunes music store, eMusic, Napster or from newer competitors such as Amazon.\" \nMark Mulligan, a music and digital media analyst at Forrester Research, said in an interview that \"at a time where we're asking if digital is a replacement for the CD, as the CD was for vinyl, we should be starting to see a hockey-stick growth in download sales. Instead, we're seeing a curve resembling that of a niche technology.\" Alex Jacob, a spokesperson for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents the worldwide music industry, agreed that there had been a fall in digital sales of music. \"The digital download market is still growing,\" they said. \"But the percentage is less than a few years ago, though it's now coming from a higher base.\" Figures released earlier this year, Arthur wrote, \"show that while CD sales fell by 12.7%, losing $1.6bn (1bn)in value, digital downloads only grew by 9.2%, gaining less than $400m in value.\" \nExpectations that CDs would, in time, become extinct, replaced by digital downloads, have not come to light, Jacob confirmed. \"Across the board, in terms of growth, digital isn't making up for the fall in CD sales, though it is in certain countries, including the UK,\" he said. Anylising the situation, Arthur suggested that \"as iPod sales slow, digital music sales, which have been yoked to the device, are likely to slow too. The iPod has been the key driver: the IFPI's figures show no appreciable digital download sales until 2004, the year Apple launched its iTunes music store internationally (it launched it in the US in April 2003). Since then, international digital music sales have climbed steadily, exactly in line with the total sales of iPods and iPhones.\"\nNick Farrell, a TechEYE journalist, stated that the reason for the decline in music sales could be attributed to record companies' continued reliance on Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, saying that they had considered him the \"industry's saviour\", and by having this mindset had forgotten \"that the iPod is only for those who want their music on the run. What they should have been doing is working out how to get high quality music onto other formats, perhaps even HiFi before the iPlod fad died out.\"\nWhen Jobs negotiated a deal with record labels to ensure every track was sold for 99 cents, they considered this unimportantthe iPod was not a major source of revenue for the company. However, near the end of 2004, there was a boom in sales of the iPod, and the iTunes store suddenly began raking in more and more money. The record companies were irritated, now wanting to charge different amounts for old and new songs, and popular and less popular songs. \"But there was no alternative outlet with which to threaten Apple, which gained an effective monopoly over the digital music player market, achieving a share of more than 70%\" wrote Arthur. Some did attempt to challenge the iTunes store, but still none have succeeded. \"Apple is now the largest single retailer of music in the US by volume, with a 25% share.\"\nThe iTunes store now sells television shows and films, and the company has recently launced iBooks, a new e-book store. The App Store is hugely successful, with Apple earning $410m in two years soley from Apps, sales of which they get 30%. In two years, 5bn apps have been downloadedwhile in seven years, 10bn songs have been purchased. Mulligan thinks that there is a reason for thisthe quality of apps simply does not match up to a piece of music. \"You can download a song from iTunes to your iPhone or iPad, but at the moment music in that form doesn't play to the strengths of the device. Just playing a track isn't enough.\"\nAdam Liversage, a spokesperson of the British Phonographic Industry, which represents the major UK record labels, notes that the rise of streaming services such as Spotify may be a culprit in the fall in music sales. Revenues from such companies added up to $800m in 2009. Arthur feels that \"again, it doesn't make up for the fall in CD sales, but increasingly it looks like nothing ever will; that the record business's richest years are behind it. Yet there are still rays of hope. If Apple  and every other mobile phone maker  are moving to an app-based economy, where you pay to download games or timetables, why shouldn't recording artists do the same?\"\nWell, apparently they are. British singer Peter Gabriel has released a 'Full Moon Club' app, which is updated every month with a new song. Arthur also notes that \"the Canadian rock band Rush has an app, and the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, led by Trent Reznor  who has been critical of the music industry for bureaucracy and inertia  released the band's first app in April 2009.\" It is thought that such a system will be an effective method to reduce online piracy\"apps tend to be tied to a particular handset or buyer, making them more difficult to pirate than a CD\", he saysand in the music industry, piracy is a very big problem. In 2008, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry estimated that 95% of downloads were illegitimate. If musicians can increase sales and decrease piracy, Robert says, it can only be a good thing.\n\"It's early days for apps in the music business, but we are seeing labels and artists experimenting with it,\" Jacob said. \"You could see that apps could have a premium offering, or behind-the-scenes footage, or special offers on tickets. But I think it's a bit premature to predict the death of the album.\" Robert concluded by saying that it could be \"premature to predict the death of the iPod just yet too  but it's unlikely that even Steve Jobs will be able to produce anything that will revive it. And that means that little more than five years after the music industry thought it had found a saviour in the little device, it is having to look around again for a new stepping stone to growth  if, that is, one exists.\""}

His hobby has, however, led to him being arrested and fined on multiple occasionshe was fined USD 750 after climbing the 41-storey Royal Bank of Scotland building in central Sydney.\nHis most recent climb, which he completed in twenty minutes, began at the bottom of the Lumiere building in Bathurst Street at 10:30am AEST on Monday morning. About 100 passers-by gathered to watch Robert, dressed in red trousers, a grey top, and a baseball cap, climb the building. Eleven-year-old Rachel Pepper was surprised when he saw Robert, who suffers from permanent vertigo after two accidents in 1982. \"I think it's amazing to climb that high without falling. He's got superhuman strength.\" His mother Wendy Pepper agreed, \"It was a nice surprise when we turned the corner and got to see him.\"\nUpon reaching the top of the building, the Frenchman unfurled a banner advertising the website of The One Hundred Months campaign, which argues that 100 months after August 2008, climate change will reach an irreversible point, as onlookers applauded his feat. Robert was subsequently taken into custody at the top of the skyscraper, and charged with trespassing. Robert was granted conditional bail to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on Friday. Robert's agent, Max Markson, described the climb as a \"wonderful achievement. He's the best at what he does. I'm sad he's been arrested, but hopefully he'll get out soon.\""}
{"id": 1312, "ended": true, "text": "Research teams from  the universities of Georgia and Glasgow discovered the mechanism the Trypanosome parasite evolved for \"sleeping sickness\" disease to circumvent the human immune system.  Their study follows a recent African outbreak of the disease this parasite causes. The discovery is expected to help develop a cure preventing future deaths.\nThe 19982001 sleeping sickness epidemics in South Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda caused tens of thousands of deaths.  The parasites are spread by tsetse flies.  It is considered one of the worst epidemics in the last five decades.  As WHO reported, subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents.  However, the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate, the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle.\nThe scientists studied the molecules the human immune system activates in response to the attack.  They were looking for the way the parasites inhibit it and lead to the death of the victim.  Of the several known parasite species, the two that can infect humans were chosen to study, called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense.  Several others also exist, but they affect only animals.\nResearchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an HDL, more specifically trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1).  It is generated in the humans' immune system and is toxic to the parasites but not to humans.  It was known that one of the parasites, T. b. rhodensiense, has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical, called Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein.  However the other one, T. b. gambiense, was responsible for over 95% of human deaths, and it had been previously unknown why. \nThe study showed that a gene mutation has lead to a change in the parasite's surface protein receptor.  It doesn't bind to TLF-1 as well as for other species, leading to a substantial decrease in TLF-1 uptake by the parasite.  The receptor is more strict, causing a lower nutrient intake as well, but it suffices, and the parasite defends against the human immune system. \nAs professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA (and one of the leaders of the research) Stephen Hajduk explained, \"Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival. But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human 'Trojan horses' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell, effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease.\"\nBased on the results of the research, humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system.  Stephen Hajduk commented, \"We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms.  It turns out that African trypanosomes have evolved a diversity of ways to avoid human innate and acquired immune systems.\""}
{"id": 1313, "ended": true, "text": "On Monday, Australian telecommunications company Telstra has introduced dual carrier HSPA+ standard for broadband Internet business customers in the Next G network. This is the first time this technology is being introduced on national scale. The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the worlds fastest national mobile broadband service. The switch started with enabling the service for premium users. After some feedback, Telstra may expand the plan.\nThe higher speeds for wireless are intended to simplify and ease multitasking of users.\nJohn Paitaridis, Telstra's executive director, network products and services in Enterprise & Government, said \"One of the reasons we decided to launch first to Enterprise And Government and Business customers is that clients are saying that their ability to access applications quicker makes a difference to their business and when they start to equate time savings and doing calculations around productivity it does become a return on investment.\"\nTelstra Business Group Managing Director Deena Shiff also stated that the efforts aren't as sudden as it might seem, having feedback of many users as the base.\nPrevious modems were able to reach peak speed 21Mbps, with real life speeds ranging from 0.5Mbps to 8 Mbps. The theoretically expected maximum of the new technology is 42Mbps with user speeds varying between 1.1 and 20 Mbps. The new speed is twice as fast. This is caused by that the dual-carrier \"Evolved High-Speed Packet Access\" technology allows networks to send and receive wireless data using two channels simultaneously. This technology can be deployed on Next G networks. Telstra switched to them in February, thus making the switch to HSPA possible now.\nTelstra delayed the implementation of the new technology until elections end. This decision was intended to avoid wrong interpretation of them by Coalition. Coalition's claims include that wireless networks can be an alternative to the Labor party \"fibre-to-the-home\" proposal to introduce more expensive wired Internet. The announcement of the new technology, initially planned on August 25, was delayed, with Telstra spokesman Craig Middleton explaining, \"We just didn't want to feel like we were influencing the [telecommunications] debate.\"\nThe political parties have different plans on development and funds on the Internet. The Labor party aims to spend AUD 43 billion to bring 1 Gbps wired Internet nationwide, and the Coalition plans to spend AUD 6 billion to introduce a variety of improvements including upgrade of existing copper Internet as well as expansion of wireless Internet to support 12Mbps. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has said in the past that Australians shouldnt assume wireless technologies wont ever be comparable to fixed-line technology. Telstra's upgrade shows that wireless broadband is reaching the 100 Mbps minimum speeds promised by Labor's national broadband network.\nTelstra has only 2000 devices which support the new technology. This is why the opportunity to try it out is being given only to the Business plan customers, and they receive it for the same price as they were paying for the previous NextG plan. Since October 5, the device will be available for sale, with the Business customers able to buy it with 75% discount and a prepaid data allowance. The upgrade is expected to cover roughly 50% of the population. This is happening at the same time as one of Telstra's competitors Vodafone is doubling data download quotas on mobile cap plans.\nAs some testing showed, real life download speeds reached only about the half of the maximum. Telstra executive director of wireless Mike Wright explained that the predicted figures were the estimates, with real life speeds lower due to interfering environmental conditions: \"It's possible to achieve better than the typical user speed claims, but those claims occur in the ideal network environment with good signal quality. When you're out on the streets you get a lot of variation where the network is subject to signal quality, your location and the network load.\""}

The phaseout started last year when 100W light bulbs were outlawed. Bulbs of 60W will be phased out next year, and incandescent lighting of all types will be phased out in 2012.\nThe phase-out of incandescent light bulbs is part of the EU's strategy to cut greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020. Replacing the old lamps with more efficient models is expected to reduce energy consumption for lighting by 60% in the EU, equivalent to saving 30 million tons of CO2 pollution every year. \nAlthough energy-saving bulbs were available since 1998, their relatively high purchase price has inhibited take-up. When the decision for the ban was taken in 2008, it was estimated that around 2,000 to 3,000 jobs would become redundant in the light bulb industry, in particular affecting Hungary and Poland. However, the European Commission also assumed that halogen production and savings of 5-10 billion euro from energy bills could be injected back into the economy to create new jobs. \nIn its editorial yesterday, the conservative The Washington Times harshly criticized the ban, labelling it a result of \"bureaucratic irritation\" and a \"war on Edison's greatest invention\". General criticism of such bans includes panic buying prior to phase-out, environmental impacts of the mercury which is contained in small amounts in all fluorescent lamps, and increased upfront costs for the consumer.\nBrazil and Venezuela started to phase out incandescent light bulbs in 2005, Switzerland in 2009, while Russia and Canada are planning it for 2012.

{"id": 1320, "ended": true, "text": "It has emerged that the 33 Chilean miners trapped underground after the mine they were working in collapsed could be brought to the surface in a shorter time than was initially feared. While officials publicly announced that the men would not be brought to the surface until Christmas, sources inside technical meetings have revealed that they could in fact be on the surface by early November. The news comes as families were allowed to speak by radio-telephone to their trapped loved ones on Sunday. Over the weekend, video images filmed by the miners emerged showing the miners playing dominoes at a table and singing the Chilean national anthem. The miners also used the camera to send video messages to their families on the surface, saying that they regularly broke into tears, but were feeling better having received food and water.\nThe grainy nightvision images, filmed on a high definition camcorder that was sent down a small shaft to the mine, show the men in good spirits, chanting \"long live Chile, and long live the miners.\" They are unshaven and stripped to the waist because of the heat underground, and are seen wearing white clinical trousers that have been designed to keep them dry. Giving a guided tour of the area they are occupying, Mario Seplveda, one of the miners, explains they have a \"little cup to brush our teeth\", and a place where they pray each day. \"We have everything organized,\" he tells the camera. Gesturing to the table in the center of the room, he says that \"we meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33.\" Another unidentified miner asks to rescuers, \"get us out of here soon, please.\" A thermometer is shown in the video, reading 29.5C (85F).\nAs the film continues, it becomes evident that the miners have stuck a poster of a topless woman on the wall. The miners appear shy, and one man puts his hand to his face, presumably dazzled by the light mounted on the cameraman's helmet. One miner sent a message to his family. \"Be calm\", he says. \"We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.\" Another said that the miners are \"sure that there are people here in Chile that are big people, that are powerful people, that are intelligent people, and they have the technology and they will all work together to get us out of here.\" Speaking to the camera, one says: \"we have had the great fortune that trapped in this mine there are good, professional people. We have electricians, we have mechanics, we have machine operators and we will let you know that while you are working to rescue us on the surface, we are down here ready to help you too.\" It has been reported that Mario Gmez, 63, has become the group's \"spiritual leader\", having worked in the mines for over fifty years. He has requested that materials to build a shrine be sent down to the cavern.\nUpon seeing the video in a private screening, family members, who are living in a small village of tents at the entrance to the San Jos copper-gold minewhich they have named Camp Hopewere elated. \"He's skinny, bearded and it was painful to see him with his head hanging down, but I am so happy to see him alive\", said Ruth Contreras, the mother of Carlos Bravo, who is trapped in the mine. The video, of which only a small portion has been released to the public, shows the miners, many of them wearing helmets, cracking jokes and thanking the rescuers for their continued efforts. The supplies are being sent to the men through a small shaft only twelve centimeters wide, and a laboratory has been set up with the purpose of designing collapsible cots and miniature sandwiches, which can be sent down such a narrow space.\nCNN reported on Friday that \"officials are splitting the men into two shifts so one group sleeps while the other works or has leisure time .. On average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft. Initially, the miners survived by draining water from a water-cooled piece of equipment. To stay hydrated in the 90-degree mine, each miner must drink eight or nine pints of water per day.\"\nBut while there are jubilant celebrations on the surface that the miners are alive, officials are now nervous that the miners could become depressed, trapped in a dark room the size of a small apartment. Chilean health minister Jaime Maalich said that, on the video, he saw the telltale signs of depression. \"They are more isolated, they don't want to be on the screen, they are not eating well\", he said. \"I would say depression is the correct word.\" He said that doctors who had watched the video had observed the men suffering from \"severe dermatological problems.\" Dr. Rodrigo Figueroa, head of the trauma, stress and disaster unit at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, explained that \"following the euphoria of being discovered, the normal psychological reaction would be for the men to collapse in a combination of fatigue and stress ... People who are trained for emergencies  like these miners  tend to minimize their own needs or to ignore them. When it is time to ask for help, they don't.\" NASA has advised emergency workers that entertaining the miners would be a good idea. They are to be sent a television system complete with taped football matches. Another dilemma facing Maalich is whether the miners should be permitted to smoke underground. While nicotine gum has been delivered to the miners, sending down cigarettes is a plan that has not been ruled out. \nWith the news that drilling of the main rescue tunnel was expected to begin on Monday, officials have informed the media that they hope to have the miners out of the mine by Christmasbut sources with access to technical meetings have suggested that the miners could actually be rescued by the first week of November. A news report described the rescue plan\"the main focus is a machine that bores straight down to 688m and creates a chimney-type duct that could be used to haul the miners out one by one in a rescue basket. A second drilling operation will attempt to intercept a mining tunnel at a depth of roughly 350m. The miners would then have to make their way through several miles of dark, muddy tunnels and meet the rescue drill at roughly the halfway point of their current depth of 688m.\" Ivn Viveros Aranas, a Chilean policeman working at Camp Hope, told reporters that Chile \"has shown a unity regardless of religion or social class. You see people arriving here just to volunteer, they have no relation at all to these families.\"\nBut over the weekend, The New York Times reported that the \"miners who have astonished the world with their discipline a half-mile underground will have to aid their own escape  clearing 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rock that will fall as the rescue hole is drilled, the engineer in charge of drilling said Sunday ... The work will require about a half-dozen men working in shifts 24 hours a day.\" Andrs Sougarret, a senior engineer involved in operating the drill said that \"the miners are going to have to take out all that material as it falls.\"\nThe families of those trapped were allowed to speak to them by radio-telephone on Sundaya possibility that brought reassurance both the miners and those on the surface. The Intendant of the Atacama Region, Ximena Matas, said that there had been \"moments of great emotion.\" She continued to say that the families \"listened with great interest and they both felt and realized that the men are well. This has been a very important moment, which no doubt strengthens their [the miners'] morale.\" The phone line is thought to be quite temperamental, but it is hoped that soon, those in the mine and those in Camp Hope will be able to talk every day. \"To hear his voice was a balm to my heart ... He is aware that the rescue is not going to happen today, that it will take some time. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK ... He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything. Twenty seconds was nothing\", said said Jessica Corts, who spoke to her husband Vctor Zamora, who was not even a miner, but a vehicle mechanic. \"He went in that day because a vehicle had broken down inside the mine ... At first they told us he had been crushed [to death].\" \nEsteban Rojas sent up a letter from inside the mine, proposing to his long-time partner Jessica Yez, 43. While they have officially been married for 25 years, their wedding was a civil servicebut Rojas has now promised to have a church ceremony which is customary in Chile. \"Please keep praying that we get out of this alive. And when I do get out, we will buy a dress and get married,\" the letter read. Yez told a newspaper that she thought he was never going to ask her. \"We have talked about it before, but he never asked me ... He knows that however long it takes, I'll wait for him, because with him I've been through good and bad.\""}

All thirteen men who fell into the water have been accounted for, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. No injuries were reported. Smoke was billowing from the oil rig named Vermilion 380, which is reported to still be on fire.\nThe blast occurred at around 9:19 a.m., approximately 80 miles south of Vermilion Bay off the coast of Louisiana. The Coast Guard confirms the platform was producing oil and gas at the time it exploded. They earlier reported a one mile long and 100 foot wide oil sheen which was spotted at the site of the explosion shortly after authorities responded to the scene, but later backtracked saying they could not confirm the presence of a sheen. Coast Guard chief petty officer John Edwards of the US Coast Guard earlier said that the platform, \"was not actively producing any product.\" Mariner Energy also released a statement earlier saying no oil sheen was spotted.\n\"In an initial flyover, no hydrocarbon spill was reported,\" said Mariner Energy in a press release following the explosion. \"The cause is not known, and an investigation will be undertaken. During the last week of August 2010, production from this facility averaged approximately 9.2 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 1,400 barrels of oil and condensate.\" According to Bureau of Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement spokesperson Melissa Schwartz, the platform was authorized to produce natural gas and oil at those depths, but \"there were ongoing maintenance activities underway\" which caused it to stop producing. The platform sits in about 2,500 feet of water, though some reports put the platform in 340 feet of water.\nAs a result of the explosion and fire, Bobby Jindal, the governor for the state of Louisiana said that the Vermillion 380 platform had been \"shut\" and that oil flowing from the bottom of the Gulf has been stopped. At least 6 other platforms are said to be connected to the well that Vermilion 380 was part of. Jindal also said the fire was burning due to flammable materials on the platform. \nApache Corporation, which has agreed to, but has not yet completed a merger with Mariner Energy, did not comment on whether the explosion would have any effect on the deal. The vice-president Bob Dye told Wikinews that \"Apache and Mariner agreed to merge in April, 2010, however, the transaction has not yet closed so Mariner remains the operator of this platform\".\nAll 13 people have been rescued by an oil support vessel and have been transported to a nearby platform. Edwards earlier told MSNBC that all those who were in the water were \"wearing some sort of an immersion suit that protects them from the water. Right now we're focused on search and rescue and then, ultimately, as this thing progresses we're going to be looking into the cause.\" \nThe explosion comes only four months after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig run by BP exploded in April, resulting in a massive oil spill. The platform is located about 200 miles west of the Deepwater incident."}

Apple also announced updates for its iTunes software and iOS mobile operating system.\nThe annual event started at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 UTC) in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California. Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who led yesterday's keynote speech at the event, was dressed in his typical black long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and tennis shoes. He began by discussing new international Apple Stores, an update to the company's iOS mobile operating system, and the release of a new gaming app, Game Center. Jobs then turned his attention to what he called the \"entre\" of the day.\nApple will release new versions of its iPod Shuffle, iPod Nano, and iPod Touch lines next week in what Jobs called \"the biggest change in the iPod line ever.\" The iPod Shuffle's VoiceOver capabilities have been extended to playlists, meaning that it will now be able to read off the names of songs, artists, and playlists. The new device is priced at US$49.\nJobs also showed off the company's new iPod Nano. The Nano, now smaller and without a click wheel, features a new multi-touch screen that allows users to touch virtual buttons to control the device. The new design is 42 percent lighter and 46 percent smaller, but still includes functions on previous Nanos, such as an FM radio and a pedometer. The 8GB version will cost US$149, while the 16GB version will be priced at US$179.\nJobs announced an updated iPod Touch as well, an announcement that had been widely expected for some time. The new, thinner Touch has been upgraded with features matching some already on the company's recently-released iPhone 4, including the high-resolution \"Retina\" display and dual video cameras. One camera, located on the back the of the iPod Touch, is for recording video, while the other camera, located on the front, is for use with Apple's FaceTime video calling program. FaceTime allows users of the latest iPhone and iPod Touch models to conduct video chats with each other over Wi-Fi networks. The iPod Touch starts at US$229 for a 8GB model, US$299 for 32GB, and US$399 for 64GB.\nAnother major product refresh unveiled yesterday was the Apple TV. The digital media receiver was first released in 2007, but was never very popular. Jobs even admitted that, although Apple has \"sold a lot of them, they've never been a huge hit.\" The US$99 second-generation Apple TV is both smaller and cheaper than its predecessor, which was priced at US$229. The new version will let consumers stream content from online sources, including Netflix, and rent both movies and television shows. Apple has made a deal with Fox and ABC to let users rent episodes of shows for 99, instead of buying programs. \"We think the rest of the studios will see the light and get on board with this pretty fast,\" added Jobs. High-definition movies can be rented for US$4.99, and the new Apple TV will be available for purchase in around four weeks.\nAmong the less-hyped updates was one to AirPlay, previously named AirTunes. AirPlay lets users stream music, photos, and videos from iOS devices to other Wi-Fi-enabled systems. AirPlay would let a video on an iPad be played on a television via Apple TV.\nAlong with an iOS update came one for Apple's online music store application, iTunes. The biggest news involving iTunes 10, which is available for download now, is Apple's new music-based social network, Ping. \"It is sort of like Facebook and Twitter meet iTunes,\" described Jobs. \"It is not Facebook. It is not Twitter. It is something else we've come up with.

The four organisations facing scrutiny could be fined up to 10% of their annual turnover if it is found that they are breaking sales regulations. Scottish Power, npower, Scottish and Southern Energy and EDF Energy are all to face questioning by the organisation.\nOfgem has urged customers of the four companies to alert the energy regulator, \"if they are concerned about the sales approach any domestic suppliers have taken when selling energy contracts, either face-to-face or by telephone,\" according to a statement. \"As part of the investigation process Ofgem will examine any evidence of non-compliance and consider whether there are grounds for exercising enforcement powers.\" \nNew regulations on sales tactics by energy suppliers were recently introduced, and, Ofgem has said, energy suppliers must be \"proactive in preventing misselling to customers both face to face and over the phone. Also, if suppliers are selling contracts face to face they must provide customers with an estimate before any sales are concluded. In most circumstances customers should also receive a comparison of the suppliers offer with their current deal.\" Only one in five consumers consider energy suppliers to be trustworthy, and 61% of people feel intimidated by doorstep sales people from energy companies. According to the organisation Consumer Focus, \"complaints have declined since new rules came into effect this year, but suppliers still seem to be flouting the rules. Some customers are still being given misleading quotes and information, which leave them worse off when they switch provider.\"\nThe newspaper The Guardian has reported that \"householders are reporting that sales agents working for the energy suppliers are giving them misleading information and quotes which leave them worse off when they switch supplier.\" Consumer Focus has said that if energy companies continue to break the rules, they could be banned from doorstep-selling completely. The report goes on to say that \"new figures from helpline Consumer Direct show that while the number of complaints has fallen since last year, about 200 cases of mis-selling are being reported each month.\" However, Scottish Power said it insists on the highest standards possible for all of our sales agents, and npower told the Financial Times that it was confident that the processes we have in place mean that we comply with our regulatory obligations. EDF added that it was fully compliant with all obligations regarding sales of energy contracts.\nAccording to the regulator, the obligations are serious and must be followed by energy supplies, or they will face \"tougher sanctions than those available under more general consumer protection law.\" Ofgem has published a guide advising consumers what they should do should an energy salesperson contact them in person of by telephone. Improper sales tactics are still common in the industryin 2008 an Ofgem investigation found that 48% of gas customers and 42% of electricity customers were worse off after switching supplier on the doorstep. Npower was fined 1.8 million in 2008 by the organisation, and Ofgem insists that they are \"committed to taking action\" over improper sales activities by energy companies. Suppliers have existing obligations to detect and prevent misselling and new licence conditions were brought in following our probe to further increase protection for customers,\" said Andrew Wright, a Senior Partner of the regulator. \"We expect all suppliers to comply with these tougher obligations but if our investigations find otherwise we will take strong action.\nHead of energy at Consumer Focus, Audrey Gallacher, called the investigation \"a welcome step ... to address years of customers getting a bad deal on energy prices on their doorstep. While many doorstep sales people will do a good job, the pay and rewards system continues to encourage mis-selling, despite years of regulation and voluntary initiatives. If better advice for customers and enforcement of the tougher rules doesn't end the flagrant abuse of this form of selling the big question will be whether it should be completely banned.\" Christine McGourty, director of Energy UK, which represents the leading gas and electricity companies, said that \"the companies involved will collaborate with the Ofgem investigation and are awaiting further details from the regulator. Any sales agent in breach of the code will be struck off the approved energy sales register.\" Which? chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, has said he considers the situation shocking\", saying that the investigation \"will do nothing to improve consumer trust in energy suppliers. We're pleased that Ofgem has promised tough measures against any firms guilty of mis-selling. We hope it uses this opportunity to tighten rules around telesales so they are in line with those for face to face sales.\"\nSNP Westminster Energy spokesperson Mike Weir MP, however, said that the investigation \"does nothing to tackle the real problem of fuel prices which leave many Scots facing great difficulty in heating their homes ... Rather than tinkering around the edges Ofgem should be looking at how to reduce prices for vulnerable households.\" Gareth Kloet, Head of Utilities at Confused.com, one of the UKs biggest and most popular price comparison services, also welcomed the inquiry. \"It is unacceptable for energy companies to mislead customers like this,\" he said, adding that Confused.com has previously \"urged energy providers to either stop the practice of doorstep selling or make it very clear to households that better deals are available online. There is no reason why door-to-door salesmen cant show people online deals and even help households switch to them.\nOur research reveals customers could end up paying 167 more than they need to as door-to-door salesmen are unable to offer the discounts that are applied online. The changes that have been made to date are a welcome addition to safeguard customers; however this review has been much needed for a long time. Hopefully it will mark the end of customers being overcharged and missold,\" Kloet continued. \"Our message to energy consumers remains the same: they should shop around online to make sure theyre getting the best deal possible and turn these salesmen away."}

Such organizations would be required to prove they were worthy of maintaining charitable status from the government.\nSenator Xenophon commented that the recommendation would begin a process towards increasing accountability of these organizations, \"I believe reform is now inevitable. We can't continue to have business as usual when it comes to organisations that have been beyond any reasonable level of accountability.\" \nHe emphasized such inquiry came about due to controversial revelations from former members of the Church of Scientology, \"This inquiry came about because of legislation I introduced for a public benefit test for religions and charities, and it was as a direct result of being approached by many victims of the Church of Scientology. Their evidence, their complaints played a key role in triggering this inquiry.\"\nSenator Xenophon said that recommendations included in the Report served as a warning to cult-like organizations such as the Church of Scientology. The Report requested that the Attorney-General of Australia investigate laws relating to cults in the country.

Senator Xenophon provided an addendum to the Report in the form of a special notes section, wherein he wrote that due to the nature of the disturbing accounts told before the committee regarding controversial activities of organizations in the country, legislation to set up a Charities Commission should be completed before June 30, 2011.\nThe Committee's Report included recommendations regarding concerns about controversial activities of cult-like organizations. The Report stated there was sufficient evidence heard before the Committee such that the activities of cults should be investigated in the country with the goal of forming policy broader than simply with respect to taxation laws. For the purposes of the Committee's investigation, the Macquarie Dictionary was cited to define the term cult as, \"A religious or pseudo-religious movement, characterised by the extreme devotion of its members, who usually form a relatively small, tightly controlled group under an authoritarian and charismatic leader.\"\nWith regard to behaviour of cults in the country, the Committee recommended the Attorney-General report on operations of governmental organization which investigate these groups such as the French government organization, MIVILUDES. The recommendation to the Attorney-General stated, \"The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department provide a report to the Committee on the operation of Miviludes and other law enforcement agencies overseas tasked with monitoring and controlling the unacceptable and/or illegal activities of cult-like organisations who use psychological pressure and breaches of general and industrial law to maintain control over individuals.\" \nIn the summary and recommendations section of the Report, the Committee concluded, \"Religions and charities, and other not-for-profit organisations ... play an important role in the community and in the economy.

The scientists considered the brain as the most vital part of the insect to protect and screened it for antibacterial activity.  The results were positive, and scientists are analyzing brain chemicals to determine the one which plays a key role.  The discovery could reveal new treatments for multi-drug resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs.\nThe research focused on insects because of the relatively \"unhealthy\" environments they often live in. Lee stated that \"insects often live in unsanitary and unhygienic environments where they encounter many different types of bacteria, it is therefore logical that they have developed ways of protecting themselves against micro-organisms.\"\nInitially, the scientists screened whole insects, until they found that the brain is the best protected area.  Lee commented, \"Without [the brain] they die, whereas they can survive losing limbs such as legs. From the locust's point of view, it's important that the central nervous system is protected all the time against bacteria and other pathogens.\"\nThe brain chemicals extracts killed some superbugs.

Hence the scientists supposed that some proteins are actively participating in the attack.\nThe extracts don't harm human cells, as the study showed, but Lee stressed that much work is needed, in order to yield more specific conclusions. \"We're a long way from these being active drugs\", he said."}

{"id": 1358, "ended": true, "text": "Researchers led by a University of Pennsylvania scientist have discovered that moonlight increases the nocturnal activity of owl monkeys in South America.  The researchers say this is the first long-term study showing that heat and light can affect the nocturnality of primates in the wild.\nAzara's owl monkeys were known to have regular activity patterns that included both nocturnal and diurnal (daytime) activity.  These patterns changed more frequently than a few times per year along with seasonal phenomena.  The study showed the monkeys' nocturnal activity increased in warmer months and peaked on full moon nights  but decreased during full lunar eclipses on full moon nights, which occurred three times during the study.\nLead investigator and assistant professor in U.Penn.'s Department of Anthropology Eduardo Fernndez-Duque explained that many animals change their activity levels with changes in environmental conditions.  These changes are called \"masking\" in chronobiology.  But the species of owl monkeys is distinguishable by its increased activity during nights with better moon light.\nAs Fernndez-Duque explained, \"The behavioral outcome for these owl monkeys is nocturnal activity maximized during relatively warm, moonlit nights. While laboratory studies have pointed to the importance of masking in determining the environmental factors that cause animals to switch from nocturnal activity patterns to diurnal ones or vice versa, our study underscores the importance of masking in determining the daily activity patterns of animals living in the wild.  It also suggests that moonlight is a key adaptation for the exploitation of the nocturnal niche by primates.\"\n\"Harsher climate, food availability and the lack of predators or daytime competition have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in primate activity patterns,\" said Fernndez-Duque.\nTeam member Horacio de la Iglesia, of the Department of Biology at the University of Washington, pointed out that the changes of activity, though seasonal, aren't a built-in biological clock. He was sure that they wouldn't happen in absence of the Moon. He stated, \"If there was a biological clock that they were depending on to regulate this activity, you could expect the activity to continue even in the absence of lunar light. The lunar day has not been a stable force as much as the solar day to evolutionarily select for a clock.

An analyst at a market analyst company Canalys, Pete Cunningham, said,  \"Despite holding 38 percent market share of the smartphone market, Nokias failure to compete with the iPhone and high-tier Android devices, combined with its lack of progress in gaining significant traction in the United States, has led to press and investor dissatisfaction.\"\nSome commenters suggested that Nokia chose Mr. Elop partly because he is a Canadian, following criticism of American candidates by the Finnish press. However a Nokia spokesman rejected this, saying, \"Nationality was not a selection criteria.\"\nStephen Elop was president and CEO of the graphics and web-development software house Macromedia prior to its acquisition by Adobe in 2005. He then joined Microsoft as President of Microsoft's Business Division in January, 2008. Commenting on his new role he said, \"Nokia has a unique global position as well as a great brand upon which we can build. The Nokia slogan clearly states our key mission: Connecting People, which will acquire new dimensions as we build our portfolio of products, solutions and services.\"\nIn the announcement the Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors Jorma Ollila stressed an expected shift of focus from hardware to software. \"His [Stephen Elop's] strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company. We believe that Stephen will be able to drive both innovation and efficient execution of the company strategy in order to deliver increased value to our shareholders\".\nNokia stated in an official blog post, \"Nokia is transitioning from a hardware manufacturer of mobile devices to a software and solutions business. ...Stephens background in the software industry is one of his key strengths.\""}

Philippine justice secretary Leila de Lima told Sky News that bullet trajectories and wounds received by the hostages indicate that some of the eight were killed by friendly fire. \nShe did not confirm, however, that the wounds inflicted by police bullets were the ones which led to the deaths of the hostages. \"There is a big possibility that there [was] friendly fire,\" she said. \"We are not focusing on [the possibility], but we should never miss that. Otherwise our report will be less than thorough.\" Police have insisted that all the fatal wounds were inflicted by the hostage takers gun. They maintain that other bullets, fired at the bus by police snipers and an assault unit, did not lead to the deaths of the tourists.\nThe incident occurred when a former Filipino policeman kept tourists from Hong Kong, China, hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists, before being gunned down and killed after an eleven-hour standoff with police.\nAlthough President Benigno Aquino III warned against people coming to conclusions regarding the operation before an investigation has been carried out, he also pledged that anyone found by the investigators to have failed in their duties would have criminal charges filed against them. \n\"Our government is now focused on taking the necessary steps to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again,\" said Aquino during a live interview on national television. \"Let me just say that this incident will not define this administration.\" The report is expected to be released on September 15. \nDe Lima, who is heading up the inquiry, added that forensic examinations on a number of the dead tourists did not match the statement made by the bus driver, who claimed that the gunman shot them at close range. \"What is crucial, occupying our minds, is if the shots were made at close range, [these] are not consistent with forensic findings,\" she said. De Lima states that the entry points of the wounds did not show burn marks that would have been caused by the muzzle of a gun being shot from close range. She added that it was possible that other units deployed around the bus may have fired on it. China criticized the rescue operation, stating that the Philippine police force who carried out the raid were poorly trained and under-equipped to handle the situation.\nAquino says he makes himself personally responsible for the incident, which according to the Associated Free Press has \"chilled ties with Hong Kong and damaged the Philippine tourism industry.\" He added that he intends to form an elite unit to engage in a similar incident, which would consist of 200 and 400 soldiers and police officers who are capable of responding to any threats or incidents that occur in the country.\nMendoza was reportedly taking revenge for having been fired from the from the Police Force after claims of robbery and the use of drugs were made against him. His brother explained that \"his problem was he was unjustly removed from service. There was no due process, no hearing, no complaint.\" Both government officials and his brother had tried to negotiate with him to release the hostages."}

The Catholic Church has been preparing an official visit of Benedict XVI for some time, with the visit starting tomorrow.  The initial plans were made last September; the visit was only announced on March 16, 2010 when it was officially confirmed by the Vatican.  The tour extends through Sunday, and includes stops in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Birmingham, at the latter of which the Pope is going to celebrate the Beatification of Cardinal Newman.\nWhen Pope Benedict departs from Rome Ciampino Airport at 8:10 am, he will first head to Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh, to meet Queen Elizabeth.  After he has presided over several celebrations in Scotland, including an open-air Mass at Bellahouston Park, he will fly to London.\nOn Friday and Saturday the papal delegation and its leader will remain in the British capital to meet several religious authorities, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, leader of the Church of England.  Furthermore Benedict XVI will receive courtesy calls from Prime Minister David Cameron as well as the leader of the Opposition Harriet Harman and other political and institutional personalities.\nOn the last day, Sunday, the Pope will travel by helicopter to Cofton Park, Birmingham, for the Beatification of Cardinal Newman  (18011890), a priest in the Church of England who converted to the Roman Catholic Church.  Newman was defined as \"man of conscience\" by the Pope in his speech for the centenary of Newmans death, in 1990.\nThe first recent source of conflict between British policies and Vatican positions emerged in February in the form of the Equality Bill, aimed at preventing discrimination against heterosexual, homosexual, and transsexual people.\nIn the same period, the National Secular Society launched an online petition called \"Make the Pope Pay\". At the deadline of the petition, June 6th, 2010, it counted 12,340 signatures.\nOn April 11th Richard Dawkins, with Christopher Hitchens's support, interviewed by The Sunday Times, said that they were trying to initiate criminal proceedings against the Pope  on the occasion of his visit to UK  over his alleged cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.\nA further incident happened at the end of April 2010 when a British Foreign Office internal memo (attached to an official document which listed brainstormed ideas for the Pope's tour) suggested many sarcastic ideas for Benedict XVI.  This included launching a condom brand marked \"Benedict\", or, during his visit in UK, inaugurating an abortion clinic, blessing a homosexual couple, or ordaining women as priests.  The Ministry immediately apologized and explained that the document was only brainstorming that didn't represent the political positions of the Foreign Office.  The Vatican answered via Benedict XVI's spokesman the Rev. F. Lombardi who said \"[a]s far as the Vatican is concerned, the case is closed.  There never was the slightest doubt about the trip.\"\nIn the United Kingdom in July, many of the people opposing the Pope's State visit gathered thanks to a new web site named Protest The Pope, which intends to organize protests against the visit. The events suggested and organized by the site include marches, protests, and cultural events.\nProtest The Pope plans the biggest march for Saturday in London, when the Catholic Pontiff will stay in the capital for his tour.

The Fitzrovia Mural at Whitfield Gardens on London's Tottenham Court Road was created by two mural artists and commissioned by Camden Council in 1980, but the mural has since decayed and been vandalised. Plans will be presented at a public meeting this Tuesday, to include details of the restoration and promote local public space in contrast to potential commercial developments and the focus of the London 2012 Olympics. If enough funds are raised from charitable trusts and public donations the mural could be restored during the summer of 2011. \nPlans to be put forward by the Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association, and the London Mural Preservation Society, will present ways to fund not only the restoration work but also projects to raise awareness of conservation, heritage, and the residential and working community. The heritage and mural project hopes to involve many local people who could learn new conservation skills. Also planned are workshops with local children to involve them in their heritage, an exhibition by local artists, guided tours and a celebratory event at the end of the restoration project. In addition to this, a booklet would be produced containing collected oral histories of the people involved and a preservation trust to protect the mural in future years.\nThe playful painting was created on a Camden Council-owned building in 1980 by artists Mick Jones, (son of the late Jack Jones, trade union leader) and Simon Barber and is a mash up of scenes depicting problems faced by the neighbourhood over the preceding decade. \nThere is also a caricature of poet Dylan Thomas, who lived in Fitzrovia, and a mocking portrayal of then leader of the Greater London Council, Conservative politician Horace Cutler, who is pictured as a bat-like creature. Other characters include an anonymous greedy developer and a property speculator counting piles of cash.\nPeter Whyatt of the neighbourhood association is jointly leading the project to restore the mural. Yesterday he told Wikinews he had a number of concerns about the possible success of the project.\nThere are a great number of problems with getting this project off the ground and we also need to act pretty quickly for a number of reasons,\" said Mr Whyatt.\nFirstly the mural is in a terrible state and deteriorating quickly. There is more graffiti being daubed on the site every month because one bit of graffiti attracts another bit. We really need to start the work in the next 12 months because going through another winter with the condition of the wall will causes more problems and inevitably more expense. We want to keep as much original artwork on the site as possible to keep the costs down. This is a big mural and it will be expensive to restore,\" he continued.\nAnd that brings me to my second concern: cost. If we dont get other community organisations on board to bid for money for this with us and to involve their beneficiaries and volunteers, it will be very difficult to secure the money needed. Money is very tight at the moment because to the current financial climate. We need to get support at this meeting on Tuesday and some firm commitments from people and organisations to get involved.\nLastly there is a danger of a commercial development on the site. A public-private partnership to create a new art feature. Because of the existing murals subject matter  it mocks property speculators, and land developers, etc  a commercial scheme probably backed by a property developer would not want to restore the murals original message. Theyd want some good news scheme, some greenwash idea that paints them in a positive light. \nHowever, despite these problems, Camden Council have offered to do a condition survey on the mural. This will save us a lot of money. But having said that there are five council departments to deal with to get permission for this restoration work, and they dont always talk to each other.\nBut if the public and local voluntary organisations show their support, we can make it happen,\" Mr Whyatt concluded. \nThe mural restoration will be just one part of a year long project of heritage and conservation awareness-raising. \"The project is not just about the mural but also wider plans to promote awareness of heritage and conservation in an area of London under threat from commercial development. In fact the bulk of the project is about the heritage and conservation and the mural is just one part of it, and the most visible because of its situation,\" Mr Whyatt later added.\nThere will be a public meeting about the heritage and mural project at 7.30 pm tomorrow  (Tuesday), at the Neighbourhood Centre, 39 Tottenham Street. The public can also comment about the proposals on the Fitzrovia Heritage and Mural website."}

When children have AD36 antibodies, that means they had the virus at some point in their life.  AD36 causes colds and eye infections. \nComparing the obese children who had the antibodies versus the obese children who didn't have the antibodies, the kids with the antibodies were significantly more obese, at 35 pounds heavier.\nThis shows that body weight regulation and the development of obesity are very complicated issues,\" Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, the study's lead author, said.  Schwimmer also said that \"[i]t's not simply a case that some children eat too much and others don't.  There are children who eat all the wrong things in all the wrong quantities who are not obese.\"\nSchwimmer said that he's not blaming the US childhood obesity epidemic on the virus, but noted that \"Ive seen children who had very brisk weight gain in a given year for reasons that were very hard to pinpoint.

In studies in which animals were infected with AD36, the animals gained a significant amount of weight.\nThere is currently no vaccine for AD36, and no routine screening for the virus.  Dr. Goutham Rao, clinical director of the Weight Management and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that \"People want a magic solution.  Unfortunately, we don't have one.

Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.\nMilton (16081674) wrote many influential religious poems, including Paradise Lost, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as \"widely and rightly regarded as the supreme poetic achievement in the English language, fit to sit alongside the poems of Homer, Virgil, and Dante.\"  It tells the story of the fall from grace of Adam and Eve in an epic theological poem.  He followed it with Paradise Regained, depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness.  \nBawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem \"to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary.\"  She suggests that the culprit might have been Sir John Suckling, a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.\nThe University of Oxford is currently digitising the songbooks and anthologies of the Harding Collection, said to be the world's largest such collection, as part of a project to allow online access. It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago.  The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom.  Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that \"[y]ou could become very rich and famous  well, famous, anyway  if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton. I am pretty certain it is not.\""}

He forced the 22-year-old student, who cannot be named, to perform oral sex on him before raping her in the back of his car and was linked to the crime when he was arrested for unrelated offences last year.\nMurray's DNA was taken in late 2009 when he was arrested for touting unlicensed taxi services and assault; he was convicted of touting in October and admits running an illegal taxi business for two years. A check against unsolved crimes revealed his DNA matched that from the unsolved sex attack in November 2003.\nThe victim, who earlier testified against Murray, gave a victim impact statement in which she stated that she took only black cabs and not minicabs like the one she was raped in. She said she is afraid to go out on her own and that \"I have not been able to have a relationship with a man since this happened.\"\nShe previously told the court she had been drinking with friends and was at a bus stop at 4 a.m. when \"I was approached by a man who said he was a minicab driver. He offered to take me home for 10.\" However, instead Murray took her to a Shoreditch industrial estate. There he locked the minicab's doors, removed his trousers and forcibly received oral sex from her before raping her. He later stopped the car at traffic lights and released her.\nThe jury took just 50 minutes earlier this month to return guilty verdicts to both charges. Judge Ann Goddard QC, sentencing, described the rape as \"a very serious offence,\" and told Murray \"on that early morning... you were in my view a predator.\" In mitigation defence barrister Philip Sutton claimed that \"[t]his may be a case where, because of the passage of time, maybe by the time we got to the trial or shortly before the trial, he may have convinced himself of his innocence.\" He added that Murray had now accepted what he had done, and although he claimed at trial his sex with the woman was consensual he wrote a letter explaining his actions to Judge Goddard.\nGoddard described this as a \"little late\" but Sutton responded that \"[t]his is a man who is in fact now removing the cloud from his own eyes.\" The man's previous touting conviction and what Gaddard described as \"a lasting effect on [the victim]\" was also taken into consideration. Murray was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for the rape, with a concurrent three years for the indecent assault. He will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life and, according to the Enfield Independent, will likely spend half the sentence behind bars and the other paroled on license.\nGoddard expressed a hope that the trial's outcome \"will be of some help to\" the victim. The court also heard Murray had alcohol problems and a failed relationship on his mind, with Sutton calling him a \"loner\" who was dealing with his issues instead of seeking assistance."}

A police spokesperson said: \"The man who was the suspect for the bomb case was released by the district attorney. They couldn't find any crime done, therefore [they] decided to release the man and he's free to go where he wants.\" A statement released by Swedish prosecutors confirmed that \"the prosecutor on duty decided not to keep the man suspected of having explosives on the airplane in detention. The suspicions against this man are not sufficiently solid to keep him in detention and so he is free to leave Sweden. No further information can be given for [the] moment\".\nThe Pakistan International Airlines jetliner, which was carrying 273 people according to an airport spokesperson, was flying Flight 782, which travels from Toronto to Karachi, when it was diverted to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in Stockholm after Canadian officials were informed that a passenger had explosives on his person. Passengers were reportedly informed that they had to divert for technical reasons, but were only told on the ground why they had to land in Stockholm. \"The pilot only informed us that he's landing there due to security reasons. All passengers and crew members are well,\" a spokesperson for the airport said. Upon landing, the aircraft was evacuated, and the suspect was arrested by a SWAT team. Passengers were taken away from the aircraft, which was encircled by armed police, by buses. 35-year-old Irfan Ahmed, a passenger on the flight said: \"We really got scared, especially when we saw a large number of commandos wearing masks coming in.\"\nA police spokesperson said that two calls were received from a payphone in Canada, but no explosives were found on the man or in the aircraft, which was searched by a bomb squad. Police warned that the warnings may in fact have been made by a prank caller, but said they had to divert the aircraft because they take such threats \"very seriously.\" The man, according to police official Stephan Radman, was being questioned at a police station. Earlier, he said that police were \" searching the plane with bomb technicians to see if there is something we can find but so far we haven't found anything, neither on the plane nor on the man,\" he said. The flight crew and some passengers were also interviewed. They were later allowed back aboard the aircraft to continue their flight. The suspect was released several hours after being taken into custody, and reports suggest officials are helping him book a flight to continue his journey to Pakistan.\nRadman stated that police had learnt of the threat from a Canadian woman, who allegedly made two calls to police from a payphone after the plane had lifted off. \"The aircraft started in Toronto at 05:15 local time and when the aircraft was in Swedish territory, a woman called the Canadian police and said that this man could probably have a bomb on board the aircraft,\" said Janne Hedlund, a police official. \"She called through a payphone, so the Canadian authority don't really know who the woman is. The Canadian authority alerted the pilot and he landed in Arlanda airport. The aircraft is evacuated and the suspect is under control by the police authorities in Arlanda. We are going to question him now.\" A police spokesperson said: A woman called police from a pay phone in Canada and told Canadian police about the man. She said the man may have had explosives, but he passed security checks.\"\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police, however, announced that the call may have been a \"terrorism hoax,\" and said it was investigating. According RCMP spokeswoman Sgt. Julie Gagnon, the tip-off was of unknown reliability, adding that if it was found that the tip-off was a hoax, the woman who made the call will likely be prosecuted under public mischief charges. \"There's an ongoing investigation related to the information to see whether it was deemed to be a hoax or not. If the person who passed on that information was mischievous, then they can be charged with public mischief,\" she said. Police later said that they were attempting to find out whether the anonymous woman had a grudge against the suspect.\nA Canadian police spokesperson said that they had received two calls. \"The first call provided vague information,\" he said. \"It did lay out that there was an individual on that specific flight in possession of explosives and then the second call provided more details with regards to the identity of the person.\" He said that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police \"take any call of this nature very seriously,\" and said that the call may have been a hoax. \"We have to ascertain the credibility and reliability of the call and try to determine whether there was a deliberate intent on behalf of the caller to mislead the police or if it falls into the definition of a terrorism hoax,\" he said. While it is not known if the man has a criminal record, it has been reported that he is not on any international no-fly lists, and no concerns were raised when he went through airport security in Canada. \"He is not on any list [of people banned from flying] and he's been through the security check in Canada,\" a police spokesperson said, confirming that the man was a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin. A man who sat next to the suspect on the flight said he was returning to Pakistan after a very long time to get married. The suspect was apparently happy, and was a bit drunk. \"When he was arrested, he remained calm and did not react much,\" said the passenger.\nIt was later reported that all the passengersexcluding the suspectwere transported back to the aircraft, which was to fly to Manchester, England, where the crew will be changed, and then continue to Karachi.

By merging with AirTran, Southwest will also be a strong competitor in Eastern United States cities such as New York City, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D.C., cities that Southwest had previously not touched much. Southwest also will be going international for the first time, inheriting AirTran's Mexican and Caribbean routes.

Delta Air Lines stock declined by 2% on Monday, as Southwest will gain an AirTran hub at Atlanta, which is also Delta's primary hub.\nThe new airline would carry over 100 million passengers, creating the world's fourth largest airline. Last year, Southwest carried 101,338,000 passengers, while AirTran carried 23,998,000 fliers. Southwest will be 25% larger after the merger is completed.\nThough some people worry that airfares will go up, as people worried about during the United-Continental merger, others, including Southwest, aren't too worried. \"America needs this now. You could go from Rochester, N.Y., to somewhere on AirTran, and from Charlotte to somewhere on AirTran.

This is an opportunity for a discounter to have the kind of heft and national reach of the full-fare airlines,\" he said.\nSouthwest even has said that fares could go down, as the \"Southwest effect\", which is supposed to stimulate competition, \"has the potential to stimulate over two million new passengers and over US$200 million in consumer savings, annually\" in Atlanta, according to the company. After the merger, Southwest also plans to drop AirTran's checked baggage fees of US$20-25. Southwest currently does not charge for checked baggage. \nOthers aren't as thrilled with the merger of the low-cost airlines. \"This is truly a shocker, and it can only mean further consolidation.

Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to improved pain management treatments for sufferers, with possible benefits for pain treatment generally.\nThe breakthrough involves a gene known as TRESK, thought to control the brain's reaction to pain: if it is defective, then many normal activities and actions will be painful.  Migraine sufferers (thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women) often complain that light, noise and touch cause pain.  TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain, which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines. Now researchers will need to find such a drug.\nThe study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford and from Canada.

Armored vehicles were seen moving around the campus in response to the event, as well as {{w|SWAT team|SWAT teams}, bomb-sniffing dogs, and police helicopters. An ambulance was seen around 9:00 a.m. CDT (1400 UTC) at the University of Texas' Perry-Castaneda library.\nThe school's website included a notice this morning, which read: \"The person involved in this morning's shooting on campus has been confirmed dead on the sixth floor of the Perry-Castaneda Library from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement are searching for a second suspect. If you are off campus, STAY AWAY. If you are on campus, lock doors, do not leave your building.\" The gunman was reportedly killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and no shots had been fired by law enforcement officials.\nThe shooter has not yet been identified, and the reason behind the incident is not yet known. Witnesses described the man as wearing a dark suit and ski mask, and carrying an assault rifle. Randall Wilhite, a professor at the university, said that he heard gunshots while going to class and saw the suspect heading toward the library just after 8:00 a.m. CDT (1300 UTC). The gunman appeared to be firing shots randomly. \"When I pulled up in my car, he stood right in front of me and didn't stop running but turned in my direction, fired three shots into the ground to the left of my car and kept running,\" said Wilhite. The gunman had the chance to shoot students, added Wilhite, but he did not appear to be targeting them.\nThe school, which has around 50,000 students, sent out an alert around that time warning students to stay where they were. Robby Reeb, a senior at the school, said that \"a guy sprinted past me screaming, 'There's a guy with a gun.' I looked up and saw a man in a ski mask, wearing a suit, and carrying an assault rifle. And I called 911.\"\nPolice said that the gun used in the shooting was an AK-47, and that they were examining two different crime scenes: where the shots were fired outside, and where the gunman was found dead in the library. Police would not say whether he was attending the university. Chief Acevado said that there were \"reports of a second suspect that was wearing a beanie with a long rifle, wearing blue jeans and a black top\" that \"may or may not be a white male.\"\nSeveral hours after the lockdown began, police allowed students to leave the university's campus, although nobody is still allowed to enter.\nThe school was also the site of a shooting spree on August 1, 1966, in which university student Charles Whitman fatally shot fourteen to sixteen people and wounded another 32 before being himself killed by law enforcement authorities; reports of the exact death toll are inconsistent. Whitman, a former U.S. Marine, shot students from the observation platform of the school's tower. That event was the deadliest school shooting in the United States until the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre."}

{"id": 1447, "ended": true, "text": "The 10.10 version of Ubuntu (codename Maverick Merkaat), a free operative system is to be released in the next few days. French Wikinews contributor Savant-fou (Baptiste) has interviewed Fabrice (fabrice_sp on Ubuntu), an Ubuntu's MOTU (Master Of The Universe), member of the development team of the operative system.\nUbuntu is a computer operating system, based on Debian, which is created collaboratively by thousands of people. There are three official Ubuntu versions: Ubuntu Desktop Edition (for desktop and laptop PCs); Ubuntu Netbook Edition (for netbooks); and Ubuntu Server Edition (for use in servers).\nBaptiste When did you first become interested in computers? When did you start programming?\nFabrice About 1213 years ago. My first computer was an MO6, and I started to get interested in programming at that age. I wrote my first program (a game) in Basic, and it was so big that it used two tapes (yes, yes, tapes). I am 39, so it's been quite a while since I became interested in computers. I was, and continue to be an autodidact.\n\nBaptiste What is your profession?\nFabrice I am Product Manager in a Madrid computing store, so I am still in the same field, even when I have not written a line of code in my job for a long time! My participation in the development of Ubuntu consists of maintaining the \"technical\" side.\n\nBaptiste You participate in the development of Ubuntu as \"MOTU\". What is it?\nFabrice MOTUs are responsible for the software packages that are not included on the CD iso image, about 14,000, for Maverick. We are called \"packagers\" (those who build packages).\n\nBaptiste Becoming a MOTU is not so easy, right? How did you become one?\nFabrice It's not that complicated: you should understand well how the Debian packaging works. And after convincing other MOTUs that we can not break everything, we can do it! It is a question of integration into the community and being trusted by other MOTUs. Basically, between my first collaboration in the development of Ubuntu until I became MOTU, I spent a year and a half, but some [users] became MOTU faster (I think the record is 4 or 6 months).\n\nBaptiste How do you join it? Is there a vote (like Wikipedia, to elect administrators), an examination?\nFabrice It is a vote during a virtual meeting via IRC. However, you must have previously prepared your proposal, by collecting the opinions of other MOTUs. The entire process is described here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess, for those who are interested.\n\nBaptiste Is there training to become MOTU?\nFabrice There is no training itself: the simplest way is to take charge, and connect to the MOTU IRC channel: #ubuntu-motu. There is also plenty of info in the Ubuntu wiki on how to participate. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted is a good starting point, and at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Contributing. There are also special weeks of presentations dedicated to people interested in the development of Ubuntu (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek for details). Being self-taught helps a lot for that.\n\nBaptiste How many MOTUs are there?\nFabrice 123 MOTUs, depending on Launchpad [the project management system for Ubuntu on the Internet], but the exact number of assets is less. It is a few people for 14,000 programs maintained by the Ubuntu MOTU. We work closely with Debian, and currently, only 2,000 applications from Debian are suitable for Ubuntu. But it's still not bad.\n\nBaptiste How do you manage to work? Do you work alone instead, or rather a group? Which language?\nFabrice A bit of both. English is clearly dominant and much of the coordination is via IRC, as well as through mailing lists. There are ten MOTU teams, dedicated to certain subjects (the full list appears here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU#MOTU Teams). Every MOTU does what they think is best for Ubuntu, within the limits of their rights, of course.\n\nBaptiste An operating system is very large... on what parts does MOTU focus? What language is used?\nFabrice As I said before, MOTUs are 'packagers'. This means that we maintain these applications in Ubuntu so that they compile, install and work correctly. I tend to say that we are inclusive. We work on those parts of the archive that are not 'seeded', ie not distributed in the ISO images (server, AN, desktop, Kubuntu, ...). MOTU methods are similar to the 'QA' team in Debian. We have the challenge of having the latest applications possible without destabilizing Ubuntu. The concept of Universe/Main is being lost and this is the definition that comes closest to what we do now.\n\nBaptiste What advice would you give to someone wanting to become a MOTU?\nFabrice To be self-taught! Do not be ashamed to ask questions. On IRC: I \"lost\" four months while waiting for things to happen by themselves, and them to be pro-active.\n\nBaptiste What did you work on on Maverick Merkaat? How much time did you spend?\nFabrice I worked mainly at the beginning of the cycle to update the applications that I had uploaded during the previous cycle and to sponsor the uploads of non-MOTU contributors. It is important that MOTUs help \"train\" the new generations, and the closer we approached the end of the cycle, the more I was in QA, that is fixing applications that do not compile, or that are not installable. That represents about 3 to 4 hours a day (in addition to my job).\n\nBaptiste How was the development of Maverick?\nFabrice Relatively better than Lucid: Ubuntu was more stable throughout the development, and no major problems occurred (I still remember that during the development of Lucid, I could not boot my PC for 2 weeks), even if the cycle was shorter (due to be released on 10/10/10).\n\nBaptiste In your opinion, what are the best innovations on the new version of Ubuntu?\nFabrice Maverick is a version of consolidation, so there are few major innovations. I think a strength of Ubuntu is that the installation is simple and the options selected by default are those that are most recommended. So I appreciate having particularly stable, but recent versions of software that I use regularly.\n\nBaptiste Are there still things to tweak for this Sunday?\nFabrice Yes, still, even if since this afternoon, the uploads are fixed. As the version is not massively installed, we can't discover all the bugs. So one month after the release is as important as the month prior to the stabilization of the release.\n\nBaptiste What is the future of Ubuntu, and what major projects are under construction after 10.10?\nFabrice All of this will be defined during a meeting that will take place in Orlando between October 25 and 29, called UDS (Ubuntu Developer Summit). I do not know what will be decided, although some guidelines are previously known (virtualization, performance, compatibility, hardware...). Anyone can go there: it's open to everyone. By cons, as it is in Orlando, it's limited.\n\nBaptiste Overall, what is your opinion on Wikipedia?\nFabrice I use it regularly to read articles, including the duties of my kids. Yet, their teachers forbid them to take the content and ideas on Wikipedia! And wikis in general: it is a good tool for collaborative work, I set it up in the store in which I work for some subjects.\n\nBaptiste Thanks for this interview, and good luck!\nFabrice Nothing: it was a pleasure!"}

This is fantastic news  we're absolutely delighted to have such a massive UK win. It is the biggest lottery jackpot prize ever paid out to an individual in this country.

{"id": 1454, "ended": true, "text": "Animal rights activists have demanded that the largest coffee chain in the United Kingdom pull a new advertising campaign because they fear that it will encourage viewers to buy monkeys as pets. The demands are likely to irritate Costa Coffee, who are determined to turn over a larger profit that their arch-rival, Starbucks. Five animal welfare groups have demanded that the advert, which features a futuristic room full of monkeys attempting to use coffee machines, be withdrawn. \nIn a letter to the Rainforest Alliance, the charities say that \"the use of wild animals in this way is contrary to your stance on conservation and, in particular, on rainforest species\". They urged the Alliance to revoke their endorsement of Costa products unless the adverts were withdrawn. The groups also wrote to the coffee chain, saying that they hoped that Costa  which has over 1,000 outlets in the UK  would \"think it appropriate to cease using primates in future productions, and make the decision to withdraw the current advert\".\nThe pressure on the coffee giant has led to fears that the company's relationship with the Rainforest Alliancewhich \"works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior\"may be under threat, since animal welfare groups have complained the new advert is in breach of the Alliance's code of conduct. The television advertisement depicts a number of monkeys being unable to use coffee machines, before a Costa barista hand-makes a cup of coffee. The advert, which features a voiceover by actor Bill Nighy, aired for the first time on Friday. Within hours, animal rights campaigners had demanded it be withdrawn. Manufacturers of products endorsed by the Rainforest Alliance must prove they \"are demonstrating [their demand for] goods grown and harvested with respect for people, wildlife and the environment\".\nA spokeswoman for Wild Futures, which runs a sanctuary for victims of the primate pet trade, said that she felt that, because they had been forced to appear in the advert, the welfare of the monkeys had been \"severely compromised.\" She said: \"With the release of this new advert, we feel the need to reiterate our long-held concerns on the use of wild animals in entertainment. While they are used in this way their welfare is severely compromised, and it has a knock-on effect in the trade in primates as pets.\" \nAccording to The Observer, \"the relationship between the appearance of exotic animals in the media and a corresponding increase in demand for them as pets is well documented.\" The demand to own clownfish as pets reportedly rocketed following the release of Disney Pixar's Finding Nemo, which featured one of the orange and white vertebrates as its main character.\nThe Alliance refused to comment specifically on the Costa advertising campaign, but said in a statement that it \"objects to the use of captive wild animals in commercial advertising where a company is seeking to highlight or promote its relationship with the Rainforest Alliance or its use of Rainforest Alliance certified commodities\". Wild Futures and other charities have, in the past, forced companies to withdraw campaigns they believe compromise animal's rights. The European Union was forced to pull a stop smoking advert last year after objections for animal welfare groups, and car manufaturer Dodge also withdrew an advert which featured a chimpanzee after animal rights groups lodged complaints.\nThe Code of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates states that \"primates used for entertainment and in the media are often removed from their social group and hand-reared, causing distress to the infant, mother and other members of the group.\" The five charities have said they feel that, because the animals have been removed from their social group for the purposes of filming, Costa could be in contravention of three of the five needs as stated in the Animal Welfare Act. \nJim Slater, the marketing director of Costa Coffee vigourusly defended the adverts, insiting that \"no compromise is made regarding animal welfare standards\" in the adverts. \"The monkeys were provided by a specialist organisation and have appeared in movies and on TV many times before.\" Speaking to Bakeryinfo.co.uk before the advert was launched, he added: Costa is enjoying double-digit like-for-like sales growth, and we aim to continue this great momentum. Independent surveys consistently prove that coffee lovers prefer Costa, and this TV commercial will help us to explain the reasons why."}

What was initially thought to be an explosion, at around 7:30am local time, forced police to shut off a major entrance into the area prompted the Clarion Inn, a two-story hotel, and surrounding buildings to be evacuated. A bomb squad were called to the scene, and an armored robot was sent into the garage to examine the scene.\nLos Angeles Police Department Lieutenant John Romero said that investigators were treating the incident as an act of vandalism, and said that detectives will be examining surveillance footage of the garage. He confirmed that a caller had reported an explosion in the area. Officers who responded did not initially find anything suspicious, but a short time later a Port Police officer on patrol discovered a Lincoln Navigator with its windows blown out in an underground garage. The Los Angeles Fire Department also responded to the call.\n\"On closer inspection and using their training, bomb squad is confident the damage was caused by something other than a bomb. Based on what we know now, they're scaling the operation way back,\" he said. \"There's any variety of things that can sound like a bomb or a blast, particularly in a subterranean environment. The danger has passed.\" He refused to speculate as to what may have caused the damage, or, if it was not a bomb, where the noise had come from. He added: \"Now that the robots have gone forward and had a good look, we are confidant there was not an explosion. There was a hole blown in the door, and the glass was blown out so, now we have to find out who did it.\"\nA witness, the owner of a diner two blocks away from the hotel, said that he heard a loud sound while preparing the day's menu. He said: \"I was cooking my food and I heard something like 'boom'! I said, 'What happened?' And I checked everything in the kitchen but saw nothing. An hour later I went outside and saw a lot of police.\" Romero added that the vehicle had shown signs of an explosion and that no one in the hotel was killed or injured. At 8:20 a.m. the police issued a citywide tactical alert and surrounding streets were closed to the public. Police have said that there is shattered glass surrounding the vehicle and one of the doors exhibits evidence that an explosion had taken place. Romero added: \"We still want to be very careful how to proceed. Something did happen to the car. Now they have to figure out what happened and who did it.\""}

Hamza Hateer and Mussa Ismael al Fartusi had their case kicked out prior to trial owing to a lack of evidence; they were alleged to be involved in a June 2003 mob attack on a police station.\nAt today's hearing, which had been postponed by a month to allow witnesses to travel, a panel of three judges spent three and a half hours to question those who were there. Sources disagree on the number of witnessesbetween nine and elevennone of whom said they had seen the accused participate in any violence. Most of those questioned were Iraqi police.\nThe killings in Majar al-Kabir followed a dispute at the local market in which British soldiers had argued with Iraqis over the use of dogs to search, which the locals were upset about, according to policeman Ahmed Hassan Sayed. He said gunfire followed and the soldiers killed around ten people. \"I was inside the [police] station with the British soldiers. They had been coming twice a week for training... I heard sounds of shooting that got closer and closer. We saw a lot of people approaching the building. I told all my employees to leave. I also told the British to leave.\"\nSayed went on to say in his testimony that the British soldiers had refused to leave as they felt they were in the clear since they were present for training only. The police left the station via a back window; the British remained in the courtyard while around 400 people attacked. \"What I understand is that this was an act of tribal vengeance. They wanted justice for the killing of their relatives,\" explained Sayed. \"We fled through the back window and the British stayed behind.\"\nAlthough no witnesses saw either defendant engaged in violence, one stated that Hateer took a dead man's weapon; he will be tried for its theft. The pair were among eight whose arrests were anounced in February; six were released without charge.\nJudge Balee Hamdi told The Guardian that in releasing the men \"I built my decisions on the evidence that was before me.

A report will be unveiled on Wednesday by a council delegation, highlighting the problems in the area. \"The people living in Hyde Park come from widely different population groups... these groups have very different customs, needs and living styles and this can provoke high levels of tension in the area,\" the delegation said. \nThe council claims that because of the 28 per cent ethnic minority population and the 40,000 students living in the neighbourhood, there are tensions between residents. They added, however, that they are actively encouraging people to work together, citing a multi-faith forum, a cricket competition and activities which bring old and young together. \nThe report says that the council are trying to build relationships between Muslims and police, something which they said is \"particularly important after the area's connection to the London bombings on 7th July 2005.\" A local newspaper reported that \"the Shebab project introduces young Muslims to role models from sport and culture and also runs scholars' talks to counter extremist ideologies.\"\nCrime has increased by 7% in the past year in Hyde Park, and residents noted that anti-social behaviour was getting worse. The council said that an anti-burglary task force had helped to reduce the number of thefts from homes. Residents complained that there was a lack of pride in the area, and at the end of the academic year in the summer, large piles of rubbish were left in streets, yards and alleyways. The report adds that the council operates a recycling scheme aimed towards teenagers, and that rubbish collections have increased.\nThe Guardian reported on Wednesday that campaigners are attempting to \"take control of a derelict school building and transform it into a community hub are appealing for sponsors and partners in a bid to turn their dreams into reality.\" They say that the unused building, owned by the council, could be used for meetings and events. A volunteer group of residents have been working on a business plan, and have gained support from local businesses to create \"a vision of an open, accessible and valuable resource for all.\" \nA member of the commitee, however, said he was \"frustrated\" with the council's attitude towards the plans. \"The RPCC is slightly frustrated with certain communication issues that we've had with the council, but we're working with them and hoping to gain further assistance going forward,\" he said. \"It's a shame that certain setbacks could have been avoided.\"\nThe deputation added that \"a major factor in Hyde Park's suffering is its high level of population density\", which they conceded is something they are unable to change.

He made the comments at the Cheltenham Literary Festival, saying: \"A lot of bloggers seem to be socially inadequate, pimpled, single, slightly seedy, bald, cauliflower-nosed young men sitting in their mother's basements and ranting. They are very angry people.\"\nMarr, who now hosts a flagship Sunday morning show, The Andrew Marr Show, on which he has recently interviewed British Prime Minister David Cameron and ousted BP executive Tony Hayward, added: \"OK  the country is full of very angry people. Many of us are angry people at times. Some of us are angry and drunk\". His comments sparked outrage from bloggers, one of whom dismissed them as \"stupid generalisations.\" Another said that they were \"sure that Andrew Marr did not mean all bloggers, but it is unfortunate that he did not seem to make much of a distinction in his statement.\" Another blogger, writing on Twitter, said they supported Marr's arguments. \"Just read Andrew Marr's comments on blogging,\" they said. \"I blog and I agree with most of what he says. I don't read blogs for news, doubt I ever will.\"\nOther journalists also criticised the comments. Krishnan Guru-Murthy, a newscaster for Channel 4 News, said that it is \"true that flicking through the comment section of some political blogs can easily make you think the blogosphere is populated by obnoxious trolls. But there are plenty of thoughtful, insightful people writing online too: you just need to find them. They might not be household names, or worthy of a slot on Radio 4, but to dismiss them out of hand seems wrong. As for bloggers being 'inadequate, pimpled and single,' that's no way to talk about Jon Snow. He isn't single.\"\n\"We know our viewers want commentary and analysis alongside their news and our blogs help us give more of that,\" Murthy said. \"Obviously we can't give opinion in the way bloggers who aren't also public service broadcasters can, but we enjoy reading other people's opinions and the best blogs are much more than rants, often breaking stories, too. And anyway, I like reading the occasional rant. But as a blogger if you offer up something to the wider world you should expect people to say what they think of it.\"\nRoy Greenslade, a professor of journalism at City University London, and former editor of the Daily Mirror, said: \"Aside from the paradox of him indulging in a rant to complain about other ranters, it is the one-sidedness of his argument that is so striking. None of us who write blogs are unaware of vituperative contributions from people who like to remain anonymous ... It's the price we [bloggers] pay a small price, in my view for a communications system that allows for public participation.\" Greenslade added that he thought Marr \"seems to be damning the whole blogosphere when, as we all know, there are thousand upon thousand of bloggers who are making valuable public interest contributions on the net day by day, even hour by hour.

He said that he had set up a webcam to record the event, and would post details later of a FTP server for people to watch.\nPeople responded to his post almost immediately. Some offered messages of hope, such as, \"How bad can it be? When everything is at its worst, it can only get better\", and \"Think of poor people, mutilated people, people who are lame or blind. Living with a disability is hard. They can not change their lives! But you still have the ability to alter yours!\" Others tried to keep him online by talking to him empathetically: \"Is there anything that can make you change your mind?\", \"Tell me about yourself.\"\nHowever, other users posted messages saying they didn't believe him, wishing him luck with his attempt, and calling him an attention whore and a troll. They also goaded him by saying, \"you won't dare, you are too cowardly\", and offering advice on the best way to hang himself: \"I recommend ... you do it from a height that you can jump off so you are guaranteed to break your neck.\"\nIn a later post, Jannes said that he had been feeling suicidal for about six months, but was too scared to actually attempt anything until he tried to strangle himself with his own hands. In response to questions, he stated that he was using a network cable to strangle himself because he didn't have any rope, but he was worried that the cable would not be strong enough to take his weight. He also told them that he had Asperger syndrome and High-functioning autism, and was emotionally vulnerable and lacked normal social skills. He admitted to feeling lonely, and alluded to experiencing problems at school, but admitted that he had a good upbringing and had a rather good life. At around the same time, he also updated his Facebook status to say life was \"just too difficult\", and that he was going to kill himself.\nA short while later, at 1:06 p.m., Jannus posted the FTP server URL and login details, and stated that he needed to hurry up because, \"I'm beginning to feel that I might change my mind.\" At this point, people who logged on to the server found a series of still images taken every two seconds, showing a young man dressed in sweatpants and t-shirt, in his apartment, hanging network cable from a doorway.\nAt 1:13 p.m., the images show that Jannus stepped out of the shot, and at this point he posted another message to Flashback. \"Alright, let's do it,\" he said. The next series of images show him walking back to the cable and hooking it around his neck. He slumps to the floor, and his body begins shaking while his head and arms turn dark purple until he stops moving. His skin color then lessens to a pink-red shade as his limp body hangs motionless for a number of minutes.\nOn the message board, people start to realize the seriousness of the events: \"Given the last pictures, it looks like [this was serious]\", \"holy crap, he has done it already\", \"okay it's getting nasty\", \"this is quite sick. Not okay at all,\" and \"I've seen a lot online but this is the worst I've seen in my entire life\" were some of the comments posted. At 1:32 p.m., a user asks, \"Did someone call the police?\".\nThe Sdertlje police state that they were first alerted to the incident at 1:44 p.m. At 2:06 p.m., the image feeds show two police officers charging into the apartment and releasing the cable from around Jannus' neck. They begin administering CPR. Two minutes later, two paramedics arrive, and they take over CPR while one of the officers looks around the room at cables; the back of a flat-screen television set; and presumably the computer, as the images finally stop being uploaded.\nSdertlje Polisen spokesperson Lotta Thyni confirmed that Jannus had died. \"The police performed CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene, but his life could not be saved.\"\nThe police have so far declined to comment on how the suicide will be investigated, but Sven-Erik Alhem, a chief prosecutor in Sweden told Aftonbladet, that psychologically inducing a person to commit suicide, or contributing to the act, can be classified as incitement to murder, and is a criminal offense.\nThe \"Hngning\" thread at Flashback continued to receive new posts until the thread was locked by a site moderator at 5:27 p.m. It had received a total of 630 posts over 53 pages. \"It is unfortunate if someone knew that the man planned to kill himself and did not do anything to stop him,\" said Thyni, but added that police can not control how people use social forums on the web. \"They lack empathy\".\nThe Flashback message boards are a controversial topic in Sweden. They are seen as being similar to the English language website 4chan, and especially its \"Random\" /b/ board. The Flashback members are able to post with a great amount of freedom of speech. The site has been investigated by the Swedish police on numerous occasions and is under constant surveillance by the Swedish Security Service due to its members' abundant discussions about drug use, child pornography, race science, bestiality and other controversial subjects. Other controversies include sexual harassment of celebrities and politicians, open racism, forced disconnection from its internet service provider, the hosting of nazi sites, and the sabotage of telephone votes in TV shows.\n\"I do not remember such a situation in Sweden before,\" says Anders Ahlqvist from the Swedish national police force. A similar incident occurred in Sweden in 2008, when Oscar Ores Balingen, 34, from Stockholm attempted to kill himself online. In that case, the police were able to reach Balingen before he died, and managed to save his life. \"People said that I would not dare, but it made me only more triggered,\" Balingen told Aftonbladet. \"I do not think they are taking the threats seriously. There is a terrible lack of empathy on these forums.\"\nIn November 2008, a 19-year-old male from Pembroke Pines, Florida used his webcam to broadcast his suicide on the live video site Justin.tv. Abraham K. Biggs, 19, committed suicide by taking an overdose of opiates and benzodiazepine, which had been prescribed for his bipolar disorder.

Rhee, who has held the position for over three years, will be replaced by Deputy Chancellor Kaya Henderson at the end of this month.\nRhee, aged 40, chose to step down after current Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty failed to be reelected in a primary election last month. Fenty, who had long backed Rhee's educational policies, lost to D.C. City Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray. In a Wednesday morning press conference, Rhee said that she and Gray decided together that she should resign. \"This was not a decision that we made lightly,\" she said, \"but it is one that I believe is absolutely essential to allow Chairman Gray to pursue our shared goal of unifying the city behind the school reform efforts that are making such a large difference in the lives of the children across the city. In short we have agreed together that the best way to keep the reforms going is for this reformer to step aside.\"\nRhee said she \"completely enjoyed every minute of\" her tenure as chancellor, and that leaving is \"the right thing for the school system and the right thing most importantly for the children of D.C.\" She was charged by Fenty in 2007 to improve the city's failing public school district, but her no-nonsense tactics caused much controversy among other educators and the D.C. community, despite managing to raise test scores and lowering dropout rates.\nIn July, Rhee took drastic measures to reform the city's educational system by firing 241 teachers and putting 737 more on notice to improve in one year or lose their jobs as well. She pushed for performance-based evaluations, following recommendations in U.S. President Barack Obama's \"Race to the Top\" initiative. Teacher unions and other educators, along with city residents, criticized Rhee's actions. Chester Finn, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute for education research, says that many people find mass layoffs and school closings troubling, even in the name of reform.\nFenty, who made Rhee head of D.C. schools in June 2007, lost his reelection bid in part due to his support of Rhee's methods. Fenty said at the press conference that she \"exceeded all of [his] expectations.\" It wasn't just the results, he said, it was Rhee's \"tough decision-making, what residents believe is a breath of fresh air, and a willingness to do what is right even if it has political consequences.\"\nGray, who is now running for mayor unopposed, agreed to a deal in which Henderson would become interim chancellor after Rhee leaves at the end of the month. The current educational leadership team will remain unchanged until the end of the school year to avoid any possible disruption of classes. Even though she is leaving, Rhee said, \"All of the reforms can continue as planned.\" Those reforms include the new evaluation system, changes to special education, and expansion of standardized testing. However, former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch says that Rhee's departure shows that her tactics will be unsuccessful in the long run. \"Rhee is out because her patron lost the election, and that loss should have taught the leaders of this movement that they are headed in the wrong direction. Public schools cannot be reformed without public support,\" wrote Ravitch.\nDuring the press conference, Gray said that \"school reform will move forward under the Gray administration. Our schools must continue to operate under the leadership of a strong, empowered chancellor who will move school reform forward, take it to the next level and work with the community so that all our stakeholders are invested in the process.\" When asked why Rhee would not be retained as chancellor, Gray said that it was a \"mutual decision\" for her to step down.\nRhee was featured in the recent documentary Waiting for Superman, which highlights issues with the country's school systems. She became \"a pivotal leader in the school reform movement,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Fenty praised Rhee's accomplishments, saying, \"All across the country now because of Chancellor Rhee and her team, from the White House to documentaries, people are touting D.C. as a model for how to attack bureaucracy and get results in an urban school system.\"\nAlthough she has not publicly disclosed her next steps, Rhee said that her \"goal is to continue to serve the children of this nation.\" She plans to \"take a little time off and figure out what's next,\" but will be going to California to marry her fianc, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson.

Health officials are referring to the event as the worst outbreak of the cough in 60 years. \nA spokesman from the California Department of Public Health, Michael Sicilia, says all of the deaths occurred in infants under three months and that nine of the deaths were found in infants under eight weeks old. This leads to the conclusion that the children were too young to receive the vaccine for the disease. \nSicilia indicated that an estimated 50% of children received the disease from parents or caregivers. Earlier in July of this year California recommended that anyone over seven years old who was not fully vaccinated for Pertussis get a Tdap pertussis booster.\nSome parents are refusing to have their children vaccinated against the disease and the vaccine has worn off in some adults. Alison Patti, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pointed out that the vaccine does not protect individuals indefinitely and health officials are urging that people get the vaccine again if they have not received it within the past five years.\nAccording to the CDC, for the first week or two the symptoms of the cough are similar to the common cold; soon after the child begins to \"cough violently and rapidly, over and over, until the air is gone from their lungs and they're forced to inhale with a loud 'whooping' sound.\" Pertussis carries side effects, such as a 20 percent chance of pneumonia and about a one percent chance of convulsions, which makes it very deadly to infants.\nDoctors and parents often miss the symptoms of whooping cough in infants under six months old due to the absence of the \"whooping\" sound. Alison Patti said that the \"whooping\" characteristic is absent in adults which makes them think they don't have pertussis. She recommends that anyone with a persistent cough get tested for the whooping cough.\n\nPertussis (Whooping Cough)  What You Need To Know"}

He said that the App Store will be available for Apple's current OS \"Snow Leopard\" within 90 days, and that applications can be submitted starting next month. Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime, Apple's IOS video calling application, would be available for OS X users immediately. Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion, dubbed \"Mission Control\" and \"Launchpad.\"\nIn his keynote address Wednesday, Jobs announced the release of Apple's iLife '11 software suite, which includes the iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand programs. iPhoto has new slide show templates, while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities.

The February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. Wikinews has also had access to the original design plans of the new kiosks in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the Cochayuyo (\"El Rey del Cochayuyo\"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake.\nPichilemu is a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, known as one of the \"best surfing spots\" in South America. Its current Mayor is Roberto Crdova Carreo, who was elected internally by the Councillors of the city in September 2009, after several political controversies that ended with three Mayors being displaced.\nThe territory of Pichilemu has a surface of 7,491 square kilometers, and comprises at least 24 villages, such as Ciruelos, Rodello and Espinillo (the latter two also severely damaged by the March 11 earthquake). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer.\nThe earthquake took place in what is considered the \"last weekend in the summer;\" on Saturday, February 27, 2010 at 03:34 local time (06:34 UTC), while almost all Chileans were sleeping. Hours earlier, on Friday, thousands of people had arrived at Pichilemu. \"The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall. It was 3 or 4 minutes long,\" Diego Grez, a Chilean student who was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake, told Wikinews in an interview.\nA concert was being held at the One Discotheque when the earthquake occurred. It is said that the audience panicked and fled outside the discothque, and then to the La Cruz Hill. Most tourists fled outside the city right after the earthquake occurred, but many others opted to stay in the La Cruz Hill or the village of Pueblo de Viudas, which are the higher points in the city.\n\"Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened,\" reported El Rancagino, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February 28.\nThe only radio broadcasting in the area was Entre Olas, directed by Jorge Nasser, which also helped Pichileminians know what happened in other affected places by the earthquake, as they re-broadcasted the audio of Televisin Nacional de Chile (National Television of Chile). On the day of the earthquake, the station reported that a local police truck had crashed near La Cruz Hill. There was no tsunami warning, and Mayor Crdova was away on holiday when the earthquake struck.\n\"Those who live in Pichilemu, and those who were visiting it, were surprised by the giant waves that annihilated its beach and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way,\" reported El Morrocotudo on February 28. \"The most tough thing occurred when the firefighters' alarms sounded twice, and the people in the hill began to yell 'tsunami!',\" journalist Tania Arce told the newspaper.\nThe earthquake destroyed one of Pichilemu's oldest and iconic buildings, the post office, which was demolished in July. The urban centre of Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but its subsequent tsunami caused most of the destruction. The Agustn Ross architecture in the city (three of his buildings are National Monuments of Chile) was damaged. Agustn Ross Balcony was completely destroyed.\nAccording to SHOA, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy, the tsunami triggered by the earthquake first reached Pichilemu, at 03:48 (06:48 UTC). A second wave came at 04:15 (07:15 UTC).\nPoliceman Jos Arvalo was the only person to warn residents that a tsunami was approaching. Arvalo was patrolling the Las Terrazas beach, when the earthquake occurred. He told El Rancahuaso there were around 25 people in the beach. \"Right after the quake, he noticed the sea had shrank around 500 meters inside. He took his megaphone, and shouted people should leave the place instantly.\" \"The sea is coming out! The sea is coming out!,\" he shouted. \"The warning was also preceived by nightclubs and pubs surrounding the costanera. Then, the tragedy occurred. The sea destroyed everything on its way,\" El Rancahuaso reported. \"It all was really quick. Everyone is safe, luckily [..] It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives,\" Arvalo added.\nThe tsunami destroyed restaurants, hotels, kiosks, the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores), surf schools, the Agustn Ross Balcony (located right in front of the Las Terrazas beach) and houses near the costanera (the nearest street to the beach), and flooded the building of the Government of Cardenal Caro Province, the boarding school of Pichilemu, the city square (Arturo Prat Square), and the Supermarket El 9.\nA local worker, Ricardo Vivanco, also known as \"El Gordo\" (\"The Fat one\"), almost was killed by a tsunami, ignoring warnings by the Police and the Fire Bureau. Vivanco was drunk, and went down to the Las Terrazas beach with his friends. The wave washed him away, and was hit on the Agustn Ross Balcony's wall. His friends recorded a video and uploaded it to YouTube.\nIt was reported by Radio Entre Olas on February 27, that the tsunami had provoked massive damage in Punta de Lobos, Pichilemu's most popular beach. The owner of Entre Mar, an hotel and restaurant in that beach, said the tsunami had destroyed all of his buildings there. \nThe village of Espinillo was badly damaged, and approximately 600 people were made homeless by the earthquake, Teletrece reported on March 16. \"We are keeping the government informed, we're also organized with some churches [sic, religious organizations] that are working voluntarily in Espinillo, Los Boldos, Alto Ramrez [...] We thank a lot their work, that is not to give them mediaguas [temporary tenements], but something definitive, but I also think they need resources to do it,\" Mayor Crdova said.\nOn March 11, Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, and that occurred 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu. It occurred at 11:39 local time (14:39 UTC), while the new President Sebastin Piera was sworn in.\nA tsunami warning was issued by SHOA, between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions. People in Pichilemu fled again to La Cruz Hill. Military authorities assured people in the hill they were going to be safe there, and that it was unlikely a tsunami was going to hit again Chile's coast. The tsunami warning was lifted at 15:50 local time (18:50 UTC).\nPeople stayed in La Cruz Hill for a longer time than after the previous earthquake, and several activities were made there, such as a concert by Chilean-Brazilian singer Joe Vasconcellos. People were also given food, wood (mostly remains from the destroyed kiosks), and electricity.\n\"We are here because we fear about our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate,\" Edith Larran told to Wikinews. Mayor Crdova estimated that at least 2,000 people were staying at La Cruz Hill. Militaries and provincial authorities asked them to leave the hill on March 15, but most refused the deal. People eventually left the hill, due to complaints by the Mayor.\nOn March 20, in collaboration with the Governor of Cardenal Caro Julio Ibarra, Colonel Ral Melo, and the Mayor of Litueche Bernardo Cornejo, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto Crdova announced a \"tourism revival campaign\" of Pichilemu, promoting the surf practice, whose goal was \"to make the city go back to the normality.\"\nOn April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. The monument was created by local artisans, with rocks from several places of the Cardenal Caro Province. \"We wanted to create this monument so we don't forget it [the earthquake] [...] This is the beginning of the reconstruction,\" said Julio Ibarra. The monument was placed in front of the beach, near the building of the Cardenal Caro Government. Mayor Roberto Crdova said that \"it definitely will help us reconstruct [ourselves] espiritually, [and that] is essential.\"\nOn October 20, with the help of the Government, SERCOTEC (Technical Cooperation Service, Servicio de Cooperacin Tcnica) and FOSIS (Solidarity and Social Investment, Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversin Social), the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores) began to be reconstructed. Caleta de Pescadores is administered by the Independent Labour Union of Fishermen of Pichilemu (Sindicato de Trabajo Independientes de Pescadores Artesanales), which has twenty-three members.\n\"The Government of President Sebastin Piera has been worried about the fishing area, carrying out several actions in help of them, after all that they've suffered after the earthquake and tsunami that hit them [...] This area is working normally again,\" Governor Ibarra said.\nOn October 6, the Municipality of Pichilemu published the design of kiosks that were going to be constructed, as replacement of those destroyed by the earthquake. As of October 23, four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed. According to Mauricio Grez, a construction engineer, the construction of one kiosk would cost up to US$ 2,500 (CLP 1,000,000).\nAlejandro Mella, locally known as \"el Rey del Cochayuyo\" (\"the King of the Cochayuyo\"), is a merchant of Pichilemu, who promotes the cochayuyo (durvillaea antarctica), and lost his kiosk after the February earthquake and tsunami. \"I was given my [former] kiosk by the Mayor Orlando Cornejo, back in 1993. It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near \"the grotto of the Virgin\"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami,\" he told Wikinews.\n\"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive,\" he added. Mr. Mella also gave Wikinews a sample of his work as \"the King of the Cochayuyo\", an essay called \"El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales\" (\"Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts\", pictured below), which he sells for 200 Chilean pesos (0.41 US$), and that contains \"tips and information about the plant, and some recipes.\""}

The epicenter of the earthquake was 78kilometers (48mi) west of South Pagai, one of the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. \nWe are predicting that people will need food supplies and shelter. The rain is coming down very hard, the wind is very strong, a local police officer said, addind that emergency posts had been set up and patrols were being made to try and locate the missing. An official said that they had purchased 200 body bags \"just in case.\"\nA local official said that most of the buildings in the coastal village of Betu Monga had been destroyed when the tsunami struck. Of the 200 people living in that village, only 40 have been found. 160 are still missing, mostly women and children, he said. We have people reporting to the security post here that they could not hold on to their children, that they were swept away. A lot of people are crying. Food supplies, he added, were running low. \nWisnu Wijaya, the preparedness director with the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the government is getting aid to the islands. \"We already sent a rapid response team to this area, coordinated by the provincial government. We have local disaster management at Padang, because right now the condition of the wave is quite high,\" he said. Wijaya added that high waves and stormy weather have made it difficult to reach the affected areas, and communication was a problem. Emergency shelters have been set up and the first team from Sumatra was arriving Tuesday evening to begin a rapid assessment of the aid that was needed. \"Up to now, I think we still can manage this problem. Maybe also we'll send staff to go there and make a better coordination. If they need national resources to deploy there, we'll be ready to support local government,\" Wijaya said.\nThe head of the regional government in the affected area told local television that some of the people recorded as missing may have moved to higher ground to take refuge from the waves. Rick Hallet, who was aboard his boat when the earthquake struck, told Australian television: \"We threw whatever we could that floatedsurfboards, fendersthen we jumped into the water. Fortunately, most of us had something to hold on to ... and we just washed in the wetlands, and scrambled up the highest trees that we could possibly find and sat up there for an hour and a half.\" The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement saying that radio contact had been lost with a tourist boat in the area which could have been nine Australians and a Japanese national. A humanitarian organisation said that there were \"genuine fears\" for those aboard. \nA spokesperson for a surfing resort on the coast of North Pagai said that they had experienced a level of devastation that has rendered the resort inoperable. Witnesses suggested that villas at the resort had been wiped out by the tsunami. One report suggested that a 10feet (3m) wave had hit the resort, causing boats to burst into flames. There was a lot of debris floating in the water, including bar stools and other pieces of furniture from Macaronis Resort, a member of staff said. Reports suggested that water had reached rooftops in North Pagai.\nIndonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to seismic shifts that spark earthquakes and volcanic activity. A massive earthquake in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people across the Indian Ocean.

During the football tournament in South Africa earlier this year, Paul, who lived in an aquarium in Oberhausen, Germany, chose between two glass boxes placed in his tank, which would have a German flag and the flag of the country which the country would be playing against. Both boxes would contain food, and the box which Paul chose to eat out of would be the winners. The octopus correctly predicted the result of all of Germany's games, and hypothesised that Spain would beat the Netherlands in the final  which they duly did. Paul became internationally famous for his correct predictions, and was dubbed by some as the \"oracle octopus\". All his predictions were filmed and broadcast across the world, and he became a hit on the video sharing website YouTube. \nDuring the World Cup, Rupert Adams of William Hill, one of Britain's largest bookmakers, said that the octopus's success rate was remarkable. \"If you had had ten pounds on each and every prediction then re-invested your winnings you would currently have over 1,450 pounds,\" he said. \"It's an astonishing feat to get six predictions in a row.

During the tournament Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that the media storm was a sign of decay in Western culture. \"Those who believe in this type of thing cannot be the leaders of the global nations that aspire, like Iran, to human perfection, basing themselves in the love of all sacred values,\" he said.\nPaul's death was announced by the aquarium on Tuesday, when a spokesperson said that he had died of natural causes during the night. \"We are consoled by the knowledge that he enjoyed a good life here and that the care provided for him by our dedicated displays team could not have been bettered,\" he said. He added that common octopuses live for only a few years. Paul's final prediction was that England would host the World Cup in 2018. A special clothing line and a mobile phone application are to be released, along with a documentary tracking his life. \"His success made him almost a bigger story than the World Cup itself,\" the spokesperson said. \"We may decide to give Paul his own small burial plot within our grounds and erect a modest permanent shrine.

Researchers at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan concluded in an earlier study that insulin resistance and the development of plaques found in Alzheimer's sufferers were likely linked. The World Health Organisation estimates 37 million people worldwide live with dementia and/or Alzheimer's."}

The Pentagon is investigating the incident but does not consider it a threat to U.S. security.\nAround 5 p.m. PT Monday evening (0100 UTC), a news helicopter from KCBS recorded the vapor trail of what appeared to be a missile traveling 35 miles (56 kilometres) west of the Los Angeles. However, no standard missile testing procedures were followed in this case: air space was not restricted and ships were not told to avoid the area. Pentagon spokesperson Colonel David Lapan said that any such test was \"implausible\" due to the close proximity of the sighting to Los Angeles International Airport.\nThe United States Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command released a statement in response to the sighting, saying, \"At this time, we can confirm that there is no threat to our nation and from all indications this was not a launch by a foreign military. Pentagon officials said they did not know the origins of the vapor trail, but they were looking into the matter. Lapan said that they are \"still trying to find out what the contrail off the coast of southern California was caused by,\" but that currently, \"all indications are that it was not a DoD activity.\"\nSome say that there was no launch, and that the plume caught on video were simply part of an optical illusion. ContrailScience.com, a website seeking to disprove conspiracy theories related to contrails, said that an airplane moving directly toward a viewer leaves a contrail that appears to rise vertically. However, this is due to the curvature of the earth, and the vapor is actually horizontal.\nJohn Pike, of GlobalSecurity.org, added that the flying object producing the vapor trail was not a rocket because it seemed to change direction. On Tuesday, Pike said that what the KCBS crew recorded was \"clearly an airplane contrail. It's an optical illusion that looks like it's going up, whereas in reality it's going towards the camera. The tip of the contrail is moving far too slowly to be a rocket. When it's illuminated by the sunset, you can see hundreds of miles of it... all the way to the horizon.\"\nAn anonymous official from the U.S. Northern Command said the vapor trail may have been caused by a plane. He said it was similar to a contrail seen around New Year's Eve last year, also thought at first to be from a missile launch.\nFederal Aviation Administration officials said that they examined radar replays of the area around Los Angeles, but no missile-like objects were detected. They also said that no pilots in the region reported seeing anything unusual that around the time of the sighting. Military exercises involving missiles are not rare around the Southern California coastal area, with launches occurring west of Point Mugu."}

The gas cylinder used, with 79kg of explosives inside, travelled only a few feet and did not explode. The van crashed into a parked car during the attack and was abandoned; the driver escaped despite being tackled by a witness, leaving behind his jumper.\nThe jumper, bomb, van, a denim jacket, and a hard hat were all examined forensically but only one piece of evidence was ever found  a spot of blood on the jumper. It matched Jones and he was arrested in March 1999.\nForensic scientist Margaret Boyce testified that there were four possible sources for this blood: Jones coming into direct contact with it, the blood being transmitted in the air, the jumper touching something bloodstained, and 'secondary' contact. She concluded the last of these was less likely but the other three all had an equal chance of being the source.\nJones, giving evidence, denied remembering anything about the date of the offence or knowledge of the incident prior to his arrest. He said in addition to his painting and decorating business he had part-time employment at a children's home which included dealing with bags of used clothes.\nMr Justice McCloskey said this \"evidence does not point in a single direction.

In February last year he discovered Steven Hathaway and another man apparently asleep in Bourton-on-the-Water, but failed to help them, whilst patrolling in the early hours of the morning. Ten minutes later, a member of the public found them and dialed the 999 emergency number.\nTwo different police officers were on-scene by 1:50 a.m. and they were able to rouse one of the men; Hathaway's pulse could not be found. Nineteen minutes later an ambulance joined the scene, but its crew too were unable to revive Hathaway and a paramedic declared him dead at 2:35 a.m. on February 19.\nFollowing the emergency call a control room requested police officers assist; five were present in nearby Stow Police Station and heard this, amongst them Driver. According to three officers, Driver said he had already seen and tried to wake the men but left them there when he could not. These officers reported this and Driver was placed on restricted duties pending a misconduct investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation.\nA post mortem would later reveal Hathaway, 25, had consumed alcohol, steroids and opiates. A contributing factor was identified in the cold weather. Driver gave a statement saying he spoke to both men, helped Hathaway to his feet and watched the duo walk away. Later, he confessed to inventing this and a notebook entry saying the same thing. He would also claim a sergeant forced him to make claims regarding the night's events; the sergeant in question denies this.\nDriver also lied by claiming he had not been trained in how to respond to drunken, incapacitated people when the force was able to demonstrate he had, and by saying he had not examined the electronic police log's entry on the death. In reality, log records show he examined it repeatedly later the same morning. In light of this evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge him and he was suspended.

Events included a 'study-in' at the Edinburgh Liberal Democrat headquarters, a 10am protest in Trafalgar Square attended by thousands, and a 'dress in red' march in Manchester.\nIn Cardiff, at least a hundred students rallied outside the main gates of Cardiff University's main building, in an event organised by a group named Actions Against Cuts Cardiff, with the support of a member of the National Union of Students executive committee. Occupations of university buildings have also begun in Birmingham, Plymouth, and the Royal Holloway. \nIn London, students are infuriated by what they say is London South Bank University's decision to ban anti-cut related meetings from their campus earlier this month. One student described it as \"undemocratic and scandalous\" as, according to the students, they were forced out of their booked room by security guards, and prevented from partaking on any on-campus meetings -- but South Bank University maintains that it was a \"misunderstanding\" due to a double-booked room. Dr. Phil Cardew, Pro Vice-Chancellor of LSBU, maintained that \"freedom of speech lies at the very heart of the higher education community whether it is academic, political or social debate\", and that \"the students were encouraged to continue their discussions in the Students Union\".\nNot all the demonstrations were peaceful. Central London saw two officers injured as the police attempted to hold back the protesters, a police van attacked and vandalised, and three arrests were made. Police, keen to make sure that the 30 Millbank occupation was not repeated, were out in force, clashing with students in Cambridge, where two arrests were made, and kettling protesters of up to a thousand, according to protest organisers, as dusk approached.\nThe group that organised the protests, the \"National Campaign Against Fees And Cuts\" (NCAFAC), told students in the run-up to the protests to not \"be afraid of blocking traffic if you have enough people\". On their blog, they stated that \"[they] would like to see university students planning to march around their campus, bursting into lecture theatres and spreading the word\", a move that would breach many University codes of conduct. When contacted by Wikinews, the group did not respond to requests for clarification.\nUniversities are facing more than 900m ($1.4bn) cuts in the next three years. This protest comes as, earlier this month, 50,000 students and lecturers took to the streets in a National Union of Students organised rally, which culminated in the violent occupation of the Conservative Party campaign headquarters at 30 Millbank. In Westminster, a student suspected of throwing a fire extinguisher off the headquarters' roof pleaded guilty in court today, under the charge of violent disorder, and will appear in Southwark Crown Court at a later date for sentencing, the maximum of which is five years imprisonment. Some protesters involved in the 30 Millbank occupation led an 'energising meeting' in Cardiff yesterday, prior to today's demonstration.\nMany students do not understand the reasoning behind the cuts. The Trotskyist student group, Cardiff University Socialist Students, wonder why, compared to the \"120 billion the government throws away every year on evaded, avoided and uncollected taxes\", the \"few billion\" required to pay tuition fees is \"tiny\". The group also advocates cutting the Trident nuclear deterrent in order to pay for fees, and wonder why the vice-chancellor of the university was awarded a 4% pay rise (to 275k p.a.) compared to last year, whilst during the economic recession.\nLast week, three hundred sixth-formers marched in Finchley, Margaret Thatcher's old constituency, throwing shirts at the local Tory headquarters, echoing the phrase \"They ripped the shirts of our backs\".

One Facebook user said earlier this week that the protests were \"a perfect opportunity for students to show how disappointed we are with Nick Clegg\", who was advised by security officers earlier to desist from cycling from his home in Putney to Downing Street over fears that he could be pounced upon by angry students en route."}

Northumbria Police's Police Constable Stephen Mitchell faced five counts of rape, six of indecent assault and 15 of misconduct in public office. He is guilty of two rapes, three indecent assaults and six counts of misconduct, with most of the sex charge convictions coming yesterday.\nIn all the case involved 16 women aged from 17 to 48, all of whom were arrested on drugs charges or shoplifting thefts between 1999 and 2006; the prosecution said Mitchell picked his victims based on vulnerability. The prosecution claimed Mitchell used blackmail to demand sex in exchange for favours; Mitchell described a conspiracy to frame him involving \"...a very small-knit community in Newcastle city centre's criminal fraternity.\" Mitchell's defence dismissed the claims as driven by one woman motivated by \"self-preservation;\" he refused to explain this further in open court.\nIt was alleged he told one woman who wanted a female officer present when searched said \"I am the law. I can do anything. I don't need a woman here,\" and later attacked her in his patrol car. The woman had been arrested for possession of drugs and was 37. \n\"Each [victim] was vulnerable, whether because of drug abuse, health problems, domestic circumstances or a combination of these factors. The defendant took advantage of their vulnerabilities, usually providing or offering favours, but then requesting, or in some cases requiring by force, sexual favours in return,\" was how prosecutor Paul Sloan QC explained the circumstances early in the trial.\nTestimony in October included that of one lesbian, now 32, who in June 1999 was interviewed by the officer in Newcastle's Pilgrim Street police station, and claimed he groped her and \"that was the beginning of hell for me\". She told the court from behind a screen how he undid his trousers, saying that in arranging for her to be bailed he had helped her and he expected this reciprocated. \"I was gay and had never had sex with a male,\" but she claimed she was grabbed by the hair and forced, with a warning her girlfriend would be contacted if she made allegations. She had been arrested for cheque fraud.\nShe said the next month she was arrested again and he made a similar demand. Her testimony stated that he blackmailed her for four years, receiving regular sex after driving her into the country, culminating in a 2003 handcuffed rape at her home. She told the court he gave her drug money, as well as a lighter and foil to take heroin, after discovering she was in rehab. She says she pretended to take the drug but disposed of it, leaving rehab and beginning to study in 2002 in the belief the man had been evaded. \nHowever, \"[my] world just crumbled before me\" when he arrived at her door and stole her spare keys, she said. She claimed he regularly visited her Sunderland house when she was away and once left a knife embedded in her pillow. She testified her fear made her sleep beneath her bed. Her testimony stated the policeman used what he said was video evidence of her committing fraud at a Post Office and in 2003 said he was going to hand the tape over. \nShe said when he arrived \"[h]e was furious, he said I had disrespected him by not being in touch. I was trying to calm him down but he handcuffed me and said he was arresting me for fraud at the post office. He threw me over the settee, I couldnt move with the handcuffs on, I was petrified. He said this is what youve wanted for a long time and he raped me.\" She moved to Durham shortly after.\nDetective Constable Cath Easton of Northumbria Police's Professional Standards Unit said she visited one woman in June last year during the investigation. Although stating she had no problems with police treatment, Easton testified the woman called the following day. \"She was crying, she was hysterical,\" Easton told the court.\n\"It took her a while to get her words out, but she was saying 'how do I know I can trust you? How do I know he has not sent you to test us?' She was frightened and she told us she was frightened. She was in a real state... She was absolutely terrified that he knew I had contacted her.\" \nThe alleged victim was assured the investigation was genuine and later called again, claiming Mitchell forced her to perform a sex act following the former heroin addict's arrest six years previously. Another woman told the court Mitchell raped her whilst in uniform in the woman's flat, hands cuffed behind her, and blackmailed her for years demanding sexual favours.\nOne woman, 25 at the time, said while in Newcastle's Pilgrim Street police station following her arrest for a minor offence she was grabbed and kissed by the policeman. \"He put his hands on my shoulders and kissed me, it was a passionate kiss. The door was open and I was shocked, anyone could have walked past or seen him or anything.\" She told the court this occurred in the fingerprint room. \n\"After I was photographed he told me he was finishing his shift, which I took to be a hint,\" the witness, another former heroin addict who said she was drunk at the time, continued. \"Then when I came out of the station PC Mitchell pulled up in a car and offered to take me home, it seemed the safest way of getting home was with a police officer.\" She had no complaint about him during the journey but said she resisted another kiss upon arrival at her house.\nThe woman, who says she has not used drugs for nine years, stated that he arrived at her house the following day and gave her a second lift. He said he had a wife and kids but that he would like to see me again. Obviously it was never going to happen but he was saying he wanted some kind of relationship where he was seeing me on a regular basis, I would imagine for sex or something like that. He said we would have to be discreet because he had a wife but I was not interested and eventually he accepted my no.\" \nShe said he gave her money, suggested they get a private room and was \"very persuasive\". Her mother also gave evidence to say Mitchell had called her to discuss the daughter's drug-addict boyfriend. \"You want to stop her going with him, he's trouble, he's a bad lad,\" she claimed Mitchell said, adding her daughter told her the officer \"was pestering her, she said he wanted to take her out.\" The boyfriend also gave evidence, saying he had known the officer during former heroin addiction and giving a description of him.\nOne young mother met Mitchell when released from prison in 2001 after a theft sentence. Days later, he had given her heroin and felt she \"owed him\" according to testimony, receiving sex in return. She failed to attend Gateshead Magistrates' Court in December the following year and he arrested her, she told the court. She wept, claiming he raped her in his vehicle. \"I could not get out of the car, the doors were locked,\" she told the trial.\n\"He said he wanted to have sex and that it would be the last time. I was shouting for him to let me out of the car, just screaming and shouting at him to let me go. He said if I told anybody, nobody would believe me because I was just a dirty junkie and I would never get my children back,\" she said, describing him telling her he would plant drugs at her home and prevent access to her children if she made claims against him.\nIn November a woman in her fifties, who has four children and was 48 during her alleged attack, testified Mitchell raped her in a room used for reading reports at Pilgrim Street following her July 2006 theft arrest. \"No one's going to believe a thief,\" he is claimed to have told her. \"I said if you just let me go I'm not going to say anything; I'm not going to tell anyone. No one will ever know this has happened. I just wanted to be away.\" She says she explained she was ill and taking cancer medication although \"he did not seem bothered.\"\nOutside the police station following the alleged attack, \"...there was two young lasses coming along. I will always remember one had a red Berghaus coat on. They seemed to know PC Mitchell and he did not seem to know whether to stay with me or talk to them and I just walked straight across the road. I was in total shock. I got on the bus home and I was trying to keep from crying and I had a pain in my throat.\" \nShe said her life had been severely affected; \"I was always thinking about it and crying for no reason. I just used to burst into tears for no reason and Im not a crying person. Im normally bubbly and happy and I really just let myself go. I never ever went with my partner again and from that day to this I have never slept with another man.\" She triggered the probe that resulted in Mitchell's prosecution by reporting him when, she says, he began arriving at her house.\nShe told Sloan she had not immediately contacted police because \"I thought no-one would believe me. I was a shoplifter and he was a police officer. I still would never have been here to this day if he had not kept coming back to the house. If he had not done that it would have been a secret till the day I died.\"\nMitchell, who has been a policeman since leaving the military in 1991, stated in the dock this month that the women had discussed their \"host of rumours\" amongst themselves and they were similar for this reason. \"I think it has been demonstrated that people have been talking about this on a number of occasions... I know these people are not always truthful.\" \"But you are?\" responded prosecution QC Paul Sloan. \"Yes, these people will grab any opportunity they can,\" according to the officer. \"They are lying,\" he later added.\nIn an attempt to disprove this defence the prosecution produced a sex tape in which Mitchell uses similar phrases to his partner as the women alleged he had said to them. \"So it just so happens the words used are exactly the words you used in the video?\" Sloan inquired. PC Mitchell desribed this as coincidence and rejected claims he had used such words to any of the women. He also said supplying heroin to one addict was far too risky for him; \"I know police monitor drug dealers homes and it would be a massive risk to take my vehicle to the address of a drug dealer. I don't want people to be on drugs. If I could help them I would.\"\nMitchell, 42, divorced in 2005, admitted meeting a woman he had met on duty for sex in 2006, having admitted the same at an internal misconduct hearing in September 2007. He told the court that if interviewing woman it was in his interests as an officer to be friendly, but insisted this was all. \nDefended by Toby Hedworth QC, Mitchell said his father's murder meant he could not possibly have committed one rape in Burdon, near Sunderland, on August 31, 2001 as he had returned to his original home city of Glasgow following his father's murder. He was accused of raping the woman in a parked car in a field. \n\"Have you ever been with her in the fields in the Burdon area of Sunderland?\" asked Hedworth. \"No, I havent. My dad was attacked on July 30, 2001 by somebody and subsequently died on August 10, 2001.\" Hedworth: \"Had your father in fact been murdered?\" Mitchell: \"Yes. And from the 9th to the 16th of August I was in Glasgow,\" he explained. Hedworth took him through denials of every charge, which he said there was \"no truth whatsoever\" in.\nThe defence also produced a recording secretly recorded by Mitchell with Detective Chief Inspector Chris Sharman, who headed the rape investigation. Hedworth told the court Mitchell is warned on the tape, made in March, that if he is charged he would \"probably be front page of the national newspapers and they are horrible\" but the team would \"stop digging\" if he stepped down.\nHedworth likened the offer to a Monopoly \"get out of jail free card\" and claimed despite a warning his client was \"running the risk of going to jail and going on the sex offender register\", Mitchell chose to fight the allegations - a fact which demonstrated innocence. \"What it means is: Resign and this will go away.\" The prosecution denied Northumbria Police were seeking to offer their colleague an alternative to investigation, stating the allegation - made during Hedworth's closing speech - was untrue and the recording did not indicate an offer to drop the probe.\nThe jury began deliberations on Wednesday. After three days, on Friday they cleared Mitchell of three rapes, two indecent assaults and two counts of misconduct in a public office. Following this, trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie said he would accept majority verdicts on the remaining charges, instead of unanimous verdicts. The jury departed for the weekend, returning on Tuesday to convict him of six misconduct charges and clear him of the same number; another indecent assault charge also produced an acquital.\nYesterday, the verdicts were delivered on the remaining charges. The remaining seven misconduct charges were acquitals, as did the other indecent assaults. Two charges of rape and three of indecent assault produced guilty verdicts. \nAt least one of the misconduct charges he was convicted of was unrelated to indecent assault or rape; it concerned a drug-addicted woman caught with non-prescriped diazepam (valium) when her friend was arrested for shoplifting in 2003. Her testimony was that he stroked her leg and tried to kiss her in Pilgrim Street, returned the drugs upon her release, obtained her number and met her several times to give her drugs. She says although he asked to go at night to a hotel she refused, and ultimately she began ignoring his calls while he ceased supplying drugs."}

They were among sixteen, all female, who testified at his five-week trial, which also saw acquittals over three rapes, three indecent assaults, and nine misconduct charges.\nOne woman, whose complaint against Mitchell triggered the three-year probe that convicted him, says she has decided to sue because he was cleared of raping her. She alleges rape, sexual assault, false imprisonment, and a breach of human rights, claiming the policeman raped her at Pigrim Street's police station in 2006, the culmination of four years using her as a sex slave. Now a mother-of-four and a PhD student, she \"do[es] not accept the not guilty verdict. I want justice and I will prove his guilt.\" It is alleged he tracked her on the police database.\nMitchell claimed at trial the alleged victims were all liars, involved in a joint conspiracy to frame him and driven by a single woman. He described her motivation as \"self-preservation\" but refused to elaborate on this in open court.\nIt has since emerged that Mitchell was considered emotionless by other officers during the probe, earning the nickname 'PC Cucumber'. \"We are making claims for damages for sexual assault, false imprisonment and breach of human rights,\" said Lindsey Houghton of lawyers Irwin Mitchell. \"Mitchell was in a position of trust and authority. He abused that position, taking advantage of vulnerable young women in the most horrific way... we hope to be able to provide our clients with some comfort as they try to get their lives back.\" As well as the sixteen in court, fourteen more were willing to give evidence against him.\nInquiry leader Detective Chief Inspector Chris Sharman said he had \"never seen anything like it in interviews. He showed no emotion whatsoever.\" Sharman was accused at trial by Mitchell's defence lawyer of offering the rapist a chance to resign in exchange for dropping the case, citing a secret recording between the two. The prosecution disputed this assessment of their conversation. An unnamed colleague who knew Mitchell said \"It does not get any worse than being a police officer with a rape conviction in prison, but he never flinched.\"\nGlasgow-born Mitchell's convictions cover 1999 through 2004. He previously served in the Army, as which time he appeared before court in Scotland over sex charges, but was cleared in 1997 before Edinburgh High Court; he lied about this on his police application.\nThe Mirror reports the total claimed to be in the region of millions of pounds."}

Lord Uist made the comments while sentencing Mark Simpson, who was yesterday convicted of murdering the six-week-old girl.\nSimpson, 29, will serve at least twenty years of his life sentence after he attacked Alexis  the child of his then-girlfriend Ilona Sheach, who he blamed for Alexis's wounds  over the course of a month. The child suffered broken ribs and brain damage. Lord Uist said staff at Woodside Medical Group might have been able to prevent the death but failed to realise the baby was being hurt deliberately.\nSheach had initially been unable to get an appointment at Aberdeen-based Woodside for her daughter; instead, Dr Mohammed Athar spoke on the phone with Sheach and prescribed three drugs without seeing the infant. When she did see a doctor the following week despite being, said Lord Uist, \"seriously concerned\" for Alexis's health, the doctor she saw  Linda Mackay  believed Sheach's explanation the baby was constipated. She felt Alexis's blood-red eyes were due to straining; a consultant neurosurgeon testified at trial that this did not explain the subconjunctival haemorrhages in the eyes.\nThat consultant felt a referral to a paediatrician would have been approrpiate. A consultant paediatrician told the court if Dr Mckay had phoned one Alexis would have been urgently hospitalised. These circumstances have led to calls for legislative changes, according to The Scotsman, which compared the death to the recent Baby P case in neighbouring England. Lord Uist also made this comparison, saying \"Scottish health authorities have to treat this case with a similar degree of importance and urgency\" to \"[t]he Baby P case down south\".\nLord Uist was \"very disturbed\" that \"nothing was done\" following Dr Mackay's assessment. He also criticised the delay in seeing a doctor, saying \"[i]t is my opinion the appointments system operated at this surgery may require urgent review so as to ensure children requiring urgent attention receive it by being seen by a doctor.\"\nHe continued \"[w]hether the death of baby Alexis could have been prevented had she been so referred is a matter which, in my opinion, merits a very full inquiry. The training of GPs, and also health visitors, to detect signs of non-accidental injury may be a matter that requires further consideration.\" \nThe same day as these comments, Crown Office announced that a fatal accident inquiry will occur. \"These are very serious criticisms by Lord Uist of the way the health services operated,\" said Scottish Conservatives health spokesman Murdo Fraser. \"Clearly, there were serious failings in relation to this baby's treatment and lessons have to be learned from this case.\"\nThe health board stated \"NHS Grampian and the Woodside Medical Practice would like to extend their condolences to Alexiss family.

He said that the country is \"too big to bail out.\" Nicholas Smith, the director of equity research at MF Global in Tokyo said: \"The one to really watch is Spain, as the eurozone's fourth largest economy, bigger than Greece, Ireland and Portugal put together. The question is whether the Union has the capital firepower to rescue Spain in the way it has for Greece and Ireland.\"\nHe commeted on the euro zone as a whole. He said \"The economic outlook over the next few quarters, the next few years, is going to be weak economic growth ... The policy consequence is going to be more monetary easing,\" Roubini added. \"The only central bank officially against further quantitative easing is the European Central Bank, but the pressure coming on sovereigns and the pressure coming on the financial sector in the euro zone are going to force the ECB to provide liquidity and increase base money.\""}

He said the world religions unite in a moral mission to, \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", describing \"a spiritual presence, bigger, more important, more meaningful than just us alone, that has its own power separate from our power, and that even as the world's marvels multiply, makes us kneel in humility not swagger in pride.\"\nContinuing, Blair stated: \"If faith is seen in this way, science and religion are not incompatible, destined to fight each other, until eventually the cool reason of science extinguishes the fanatical flames of religion.\"\nHitchens listed numerous aspects of religion he thought were negative, arguing \"is it good for the world to appeal to our credulity and not to our scepticism? Is it good for the world to worship a deity that takes sides in wars and human affairs? To appeal to our fear and to our guilt, is it good for the world? To our terror, our terror of death, is it good to appeal?\"\nPressing his points, Hitchens asserted: \"To preach guilt and shame about the sexual act and the sexual relationship, is this good for the world? And asking yourself all the while, are these really religious responsibilities, as I maintain they are? To terrify children with the image of hell and eternal punishment, not just of themselves, but their parents and those they love. Perhaps worst of all, to consider women an inferior creation, is that good for the world, and can you name me a religion that has not done that?\"\nBlair responded, \"I don't think we should think that because you can point to examples of prejudice in the name of religion, that bigotry and prejudice and wrongdoing are wholly owned subsidiaries of religion.\"\nBefore the debate, the audience opposed the motion 57% to 22% (21% undecided).

There was also another extremely serious incursion in September of this year where the Guardia Civil removed a suspect who was about to be arrested by the Royal Gibraltar Police inside our territorial waters.

The small sample shows, over several months, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Bahrain asserting that further sanctions against Iran will likely have no effect.\nEarly November last year, General David Petraeus discussed the situation with King Hamad of Bahrain, who argued for the use of force to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions; stating: \"The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it.\"\nIn that meeting concern was expressed that more Arab involvement in Iraq was needed to frustrate Iranian plans. Petraeus was told Bahrain sought Egyptians and Saudis support, but talks with the latter revealed no interest in taking a leading rle.\nThe King did welcome the prospect of India becoming involved in the region as a stabilising influence.\nA mid-December meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE and US Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman saw the subject brought up again. In a discussion that touched on the two countries renewable energy plans, and reliable movement of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, the Prince asserted Iran saw itself as spearheading a campaign for a \"Persian Empire in the 21st Century.\" Alleging Iran has established \"emirates\" in Kuwait, Bahrain, Eastern Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, Yemen, and South Lebanon, his picture of Iranian nuclear ambitions is \"Al-Qaeda is not going to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time.\"\nFile:Iran strait of hormuz 2004.jpg\nThe Prince was keen to stress that those in power are the same people who, in 1979, seized the US embassy in Tehran.\nSubsequent talks between a congressional appropriations sub-committee and UAE's Foreign Minister were the scene of equally serious predictions. The sub-committee, consisting of Nita Lowey, Tom Cole, Barbara Lee, and Donna Edwards, heard from Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan that if Iran became a nuclear state the rest of the region would likely follow suit.\nPlans to keep the fifteen-millions-plus barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz each day moving were discussed. Whilst keen to weaken Iranian ties with China, Sheikh Abdullah stressed the US$50 billion in trade between the two; this being considered an obstacle to China backing, and enforcing, a stronger sanctions regime.\nThe sub-committee's Emirates host, like many in the region, stated progress on the Israeli peace process was a good route to de-escalation.\nA meeting in February this year with Kuwaiti Interior Minister Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah was the scene of comparable warnings. Alongside discussions on travel restrictions to be enforced against former Guantanamo Bay detainees, he described Iran as the \"beating heart\" of Islamic Extremism.\nConcerns over Iran's involvement in Yemen were discussed, with the minister saying Iran is intent on exporting its revolution; that its nuclear ambitions can only be thwarted by force.\nUpdating the US on perceived Iranian actions, he claimed they were attempting to infiltrate Egypt by recruiting the poor. And, they were becoming involved in the drugs trade, shipping narcotics into Yemen to fund militants.\nThe cable on the Kuwait meeting closes referring recipients to a wiki page: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Kuwait. Wikinews has been informed this is a page on the US intelligence community's Intellipedia; an internally-maintained project, based on the same technology as Wikipedia, and intended for use in building intelligence dossiers on countries, regions, their politicians, diplomats, plus political and terrorist groups.\nA cable originating in London from January this year is corroborated by later U.S. news reports; hinting that the Iranian government may indeed be using tactics more reminiscent of the cold-war.\nIn the opening weeks of the year, London-based Voice of America commentator Ali Reza Nourizadeh was advised that Mohammed Reza Sadeqinia intended to target him for assassination, along with others. Sadeqinia was previously arrested in California, and prosecuted for attempting to hire a hit man. The target at that time was reported to be Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd, one of the main figures behind Tondar  a loose collection of in-exile Iranians opposed to the current regime.\nTehran insists Tondar is a terrorist organisation, accusing it of being responsible for a 2008 bombing that killed 14.\nSadeqinia, who worked as a painter in Ann Arbour, was arrested on July 28, 2009 near Los Angeles International Airport in possession of thousands of dollars and an Iranian passport. FBI investigations into his possible Iranian government ties were still ongoing a month before his scheduled release in July this year. \nFound guilty by Los Angeles Superior Court of attempting to hire someone to murder Sharmahd, he had been expected to spend around a year in jail.

Bush presidency, with Eduardo Aguirre serving as ambassador in Madrid. He is cited as having \"personally exerted\" pressure on Spain's government and judiciary; this leading to at least three investigations being dropped.\nOf concern to the press is the death of Jos Couso in 2003. The Spanish cameraman was killed during the battle for Baghdad; the Spanish judiciary intended to prosecute three US servicemen over the fatality.\nAmerican use of Spanish air bases for 'extraordinary rendition' was a second concern the US embassy in Madrid pressured the government on. Spanish prosecutors had been keen to pursue 13 CIA officers over the illegal flights.\nRepeatedly, concern over Spain's independent judiciary invoking 'universal jurisdiction' appears in leaked cables. Reports at the time showed magistrates considered actions at Guantanamo Bay torture, and seemed keen to pursue ex-US government officials on grounds of \"criminal responsibility\".\nCable 06MADRID1914 highlights the cases of Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed and Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien; respectively transferred from Guantanamo Bay, to Spanish custody, in February 2004 and July 2005.\nDescribing conditions at the Cuban detention centre as \"impossible to explain, much less justify\", Hamed  better known as the \"Spanish Taliban\"  saw a July 2006 ruling by the country's Supreme Court annul his six-year prison sentence, granting him an immediate release. The ruling cast doubt on the reliability of evidence against Lahcen, who was released on bail.\nHamed and his family, at the time, announced their intent to sue the US government over his suffering in Guantanamo Bay.\nLater cables illustrate how concerned the Bush administration were over possible prosecution by Baltasar Garzn. Citing an op-ed he penned for a Spanish paper in March 2007, and this subsequently being picked up by Socialist Party secretary Jos Blanco Lopz. Pronouncements by the two, and others, on \"criminal responsibility\" were met with a diplomatically stern response; cable 07MADRID546 states that the government of Spain was \"cautioned that continued statements on this issue by senior Spanish figures would be viewed negatively.\"\nGarzn, best-known for indicting former dictator Augusto Pinochet, seemed to still trouble US diplomats when planning high-level defence talks in March 2007. Mention is made to a possible investigation, and indictment of, Donald Rumsfeld. Spain had informed the US embassy in Madrid the judge in the case was working to dismiss it.\nAs recently as March last year, Garzn sought to prosecute officials from the Bush administration.\nNamed as potential defendants in a Reuters report, John Ashcroft, John Yoo, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and, aide to Vice-President Dick Cheney, David Addington were all being investigated by Garzn.\nCome April this year, Garzn himself faced prosecution. A probe into Franco-era war crimes saw him suspended, possibly to be tried for acting contrary to an amnesty extended to Franco supporters. It is alleged he \"acted without jurisdiction\".\nAt present, the former Spanish Supreme Court judge is working at the International Criminal Court. Reports based on El Pais' investigation around the leaked cables suggest the country's judiciary has been politicised to suit American interests.\nWith a price of US$85,000 cited for each former Guantanamo Bay detainee that Spain was to take, recent reports assert other countries have been offered financial incentives to help empty the camp.\nBelgium, alongside Spain, was supposedly offered more influence within the European Union in exchange for cooperating with US plans.\nKuwait's interior minister is said to have refused to take any of their citizens from the camp. Describing inmates as \"rotten\", DPA alleges he told the US to \"get rid of\" detainees in an Afghan war zone.\nYemen, in exchange for agreeing to take Guantanamo detainees, is said to have asked for US$11 million for the construction of a centre to rehabilitate Muslim extremists.\nSo far, only a tiny fraction of the documents in Wikileaks possession have been made public."}

I hope it will change the way that Europe and the world view Russiaand hopefully change the opinion of Russian people too.\"\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the ruling Emir of Qatar, praised FIFA for \"believing in change\".

While only 1.7 million people live in Qatar, the bid representatives said that football is popular there. It was thought that there may be concerns that the extreme heat in Qatar would put the delegates off. Hassan Al-Thawadi, the chief executive of the bid, played down the fears. \"We know it would be a bold gamble and an exciting prospect but with no risk,\" he said. \"Heat is not and will not be an issue.\"\n\"Everyone is celebrating in the Middle East; everyone was behind us since the very beginning. They believed in us the whole way. And Im so glad FIFA believed in us as well,\" Al Thani added. \"Im speechless, but very proud and happy. Im so proud that the Middle East was recognised by FIFA. We are so privileged to have a tournament like this coming to our region for the first time. It shows the value of FIFA and what it stands for as an organisation. As I promised, we will not let FIFA down. Everything we have promised until now will become a reality.\" Speaking about why Qatar won the bid, he said: \"What made us different is that we pushed the boundaries; we created new concepts, things which were not conventional but still very possible, very realistic for a country like ours. Therefore we are very proud to represent a new era, a new age for FIFA to look towards the futurethe World Cup is for everyone. \nThere was disappointment in the countries which were beaten by Russia and Qatar. \"Naturally we are hugely disappointed. At the same time we gave it our best shot,\" said England ambassador Gary Lineker. \"It was very well presented by our bid team. All you can do is wish Russia well and hope they have a really good World Cup but I wish it was us.\" A journalist in Spain reported that there was \"bitter disappointment here amongst Spanish fans,\" and added that the economic crisis in the country may have been to blame. American supporters watching on large screens in Washington, D.C. were, when it was announced Qatar had won, \"simply stunnedno booing or tears, but disbelief; and then a minute later, every face shows honest disappointment,\" a BBC correspondent said.\nThe managing director for the Spain-Portugal joint bid, Miguel Angel Lopez, commented on losing out to Russia. FIFA thought it was better to promote football in other latitudes and there we are,\" he said. \"The decision is focused on taking football to regions which have never held a World Cup.\" Former Belgian footballer Marc Wilmots said: Russia is a political choice and Qatar is an economic choice. You can say that to some extent the sport has been the loser with the decision for these two World Cups.\nHoward Stringer, Japan's bid chairman and CEO of Sony said: We had it in 2002that was too big a mountain to climb. I was hoping we could get Japan another missionthe chance to do something spectacular in technology for society. The vice-president of the Japan Football Association Kuniya Daini added: We had heard people say our bid was too soon so its possible that was the reason. We knew it would be tough but its still a big disappointment. We have set a target of hosting the World Cup alone by 2050 so we will be bidding again. The Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib told local media: Were all pretty shattered over here. It was a bit unexpected because we thought we had run a first-class campaign to win. We did our best ... unfortunately it wasnt the case. \nMaking the announcement, Blatter said: \"We have had four bidders for 2018 and we can have only one winner. Three of the bidding associations must go home saying 'what a pity'. But they must say football is not only by winning but football is also a school of life where you learn to lose. That's not easy.\" The 2010 World Cup was held earlier this year in South Africa, and Brazil will host the 2014 World Cup. When the bids for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were announced in March 2009, Blatter praised the number of countries who wanted to host. \"We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.\""}

Wikileaks is this week releasing more than 250,000 secret \"cables\" between US diplomats.\nTwo weeks ago, Swedish authorities ordered the arrest of Assange for suspected rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, yesterday released a \"Red Notice\" calling for Assange's arrest. Interpol stated that this type of notice is not an arrest warrant, but a request \"to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition.\"\nThe incidents are alleged to have occurred in August of this year, several weeks after Assange released 75,000 documents detailing US military actions in Afghanistan. \"The background is that he has to be heard in this investigation and we haven't been able to get a hold of him to question him,\" said Marianne Ny, director of prosecution in Sweden. \nIt was first reported that he was suspected of rape later in August, when he described the allegations as part of a \"smear campaign\" against Wikileaks. Wikinews reported at the time that he said \"the charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing.\" A statement posted on Wikileaks' website after the charges were announced defended Assange. \"We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of these allegations. We the people behind WikiLeaks think highly of Julian and he has our full support. While Julian is focusing on his defenses and clearing his name, WikiLeaks will be continuing its regular operations.\"\nAssange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, said that the allegations against him were made after the two women he is alleged to have raped found out that he was in relationships with both at the same time. \"Only after the women became aware of each other's relationships with Mr. Assange did they make their allegations against him,\" Stephens said in a statement. \nStephens added that he had not \"received a single written word, at any time, in any form, from Swedish authorities on the Swedish investigation against our client,\" and he and Assange had only learnt about the case through reports in the media. \"[This is] a clear contravention to Article 6 of the European Convention, which states that every accused must be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him,\" he added.\nAssange is currently residing in an unknown location. It has been reported he has attempted to disguise himself by cutting and dying his hair. He told Forbes magazine recently that Wikileaks has obtained documents containing evidence of corruption within a major US bank. He has reportedly been paying in cash and with friends' credit cards. \nSpeaking about the release of the cables, he told ABC News: \"US officials have for 50 years trotted out this line when they are afraid the public is going to see how they really behave.\" It was reported on Wednesday that Ecuador, a country which critically opposes US policies, has offered Assange residency.\nAlong with the arrest, Assange is facing mounting pressure in the US over the leak of the cables. A retired CIA agent, Peter King, said Wikileaks should be designated a \"terrorist organisation,\" and called for Wikileaks and Assange to be prosecuted for the release.\nOn Monday evening, Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, condemned the publishing of the files, thought to be leaked by Bradley Manning, who served as an intelligence analyst with the US Army before being arrested. \n\"It is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations, that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity,\" Clinton said. \"There is nothing laudable about endangering innocent people, and there is nothing brave about sabotaging peaceful relations between nations on which our common security depends.\" She added that the US \"deeply regrets\" the leakage of the files.\nSpeaking to Time magazine on the internet, Assange defended the release of the files. \"It is not our goal to achieve a more transparent society, it's our goal to achieve a more just society,\" he said. He also confirmed that Wikileaks has obtained more classified material, saying:\"[W]e have a lot of source material that ... remains unpublished.\" Assange added that it was \"very important\" to him that \"the law is not what, not simply what, powerful people would want others to believe it is.\"\nAssange said in the interview with Time that all the documents had been reviewed and all names of informants had been redacted \"carefully.\" He said: \"They are all reviewed, and they're all redacted either by us or by the newspapers concerned.\" He also said that Wikileaks \"formally asked the State Department for assistance with that.

Some Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, which power some Airbus A380 \"superjumbos\", may be prone to \"fatigue cracking\", which could lead to oil leakage and a fire.\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said they think this was \"central to the engine failure\" which occurred on a Qantas A380 on November 4, shortly after take-off from Singapore. The airline grounded all six of its fleet of A380s so they could undergo safety checks before they were put back into service. Late last month, Qantas announced the aircraft were safe and began returning them to service.\nThe ATSB said the manufacturing fault with the Trent 900 engines \"could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire.\" The agency urged Rolls-Royce to \"address the safety issue and take actions necessary to ensure the safety of flight operations in transport aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 series engines.\"\nQantas emphasised on Thursday that there was \"no immediate risk to flight safety,\" but said they would conduct further investigations. A statement from the airline said: \"Qantas currently has two A380 aircraft in operational service, following the grounding of the fleet on 4 November. Both A380 aircraft will be inspected at the Qantas Jet Base in Sydney. Inspections will commence this afternoon.\" Two other airlines use A380 aircraft with Trent engines, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines; Singapore Airlines said they were checking the engines of their A380s \"on a daily basis\". They said: \"The new checks advised by the ATSB will be carried out as quickly as possible.\"\nThe incident in Singapore was embarrassing for Airbus. Aviation journalist Tom Ballantyne said the incident in Singapore was \"certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations.\" The A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, and is now in service with several other airlines, including Air France and Emirates. It is the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, with an 840-passenger maximum capacity, though Qantas' can carry 450."}

Jon Rosamond, editor of a naval magazine said that it \"has been offered by the MoD for non-warlike purposes.\" No bids have yet been received, but it is thought that it could sell for 2m.\nDuring service, the vessel's four Rolls-Royce engines could propel it to a top speed of 28 knots, with a range of 7,000 nautical miles. The flight deck carried eighteen British Aerospace Harrier II fighter jets, and four Westland Sea King helicopters. In recent years, however, she has been reduced to reserve.

It was decided by the army to begin anew after a \"red team\" recommended that the army either upgrade the existing ground vehicle fleet or rewrite the requirements. Program officials choose to end evaluations of vehicle submissions and to begin again in two months with new requirements.\nThe previous design requirements emphasized modularity, affordability, rapid design and low risk technology. The infantry fighting vehicle variant would have carried a crew of three and nine infantry dismounts. It was initially to be compatible with the current Battle Command Control and Communications Suite but would gradually use a more revolutionary network. The system would support networking between external systems, vehicles and soldiers. It was to be transportable by C-17 cargo aircraft, rail, and ship and be as logistically deployable as the Stryker. The army officials were open to tracked or wheeled submissions but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements. The vehicle had an off-road speed requirement of 30 mph (50 km/h) and was required to deliver improved maintainability and consume less fuel than the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The army wanted the vehicle to leverage an autocannon, a anti-tank guided missile system and non-lethal weapons. The army wanted the vehicle to have the blast protection level equal to the MRAP and supplement armor with active protection systems.\nThe army wanted the first vehicle variant to be a troop carrier that would displace the aging M113 APCs and M2 Bradleys. Later, other variants of the GCV would appear.\nThere were four known competing contractors for the Ground Combat Vehicle contract. BAE Systems led a team consisting of Northrop Grumman, QinetiQ, and Saft Group. BAE offered a tracked vehicle with a hybrid-electric engine, a baseline weight of 53 tons and a maximum weight tolerance of 75 tons for modular armor and various countermeasures including a V-hull and active protection systems. General Dynamics led a team consisting of Lockheed Martin, Detroit Diesel, and Raytheon. General Dynamics offered a vehicle using diesel and leveraging an active protection system. SAIC led a consortium called Team Full Spectrum which included Boeing, Krauss-Maffei, and Rheinmetall. SAIC offered a vehicle based on the Puma. Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems (ADVS) submitted its proposal for a wheeled vehicle but was rejected for being non-compliant.\nThe predecessor to the GCV, the Manned Ground Vehicle family, was canceled in April 2009. Similar programs like the M8 light tank and XM2001 Crusader have also been scrapped in the past. The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, and Ground Combat Vehicle programs have been targeted for cancellation by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform."}

If the government had activated such regulations, they would have come into force in 2013. The current government have decided not to activate this requirement and instead will only ask businesses to provide this data voluntarily and will set an \"aspiration\" to dramatically increase the number of women in senior positions in business.\nLynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP and coalition Equalities Minister, in announcing the plans stated that the government wishes \"to move away from the arrogant notion that government knows best, to one where government empowers individuals, businesses and communities to make change happen.\"\nFeatherstone announced the policy at the School of Management at Cranfield University, who have conducted research finding that only 12.5% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women, up from 12.2% last year\"glacially slow\" progress according to business commentator David Prosser.\nFeatherstone justified not implementing the pay audits due to the economic costs: \"Right at this moment of financial peril to the nation is perhaps not the moment to introduce mandatory pay audits.\"\nThis breaks with a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment, as well as contradicting Featherstone's own words two years ago in support of the audit: \"A voluntary audit system for private industry is hardly worth the paper it's printed on. We need to know when the government actually plans to step in if progress isn't made.\"\nWomen's groups and trade unions have condemned this move. Dave Prentis, the general secretary of UNISON, Britain's second largest trade union, said that this is an example of the government \"stripping down its commitment to equality\".\nPrentis continued: \"It is a disgrace that women are still getting paid less than men. This move threatens to turn the clock back on all the progress already made with equal pay.\"\nCeri Goddard, the chief executive of the feminist campaigning group the Fawcett Society, condemned the plans: \"The persistent gap in pay between men and women is one of the starkest examples of inequality in the UK today. The government's decision not to bring into force section 78 is a huge disappointment and means this injustice will continue for a long time to come. The government has today consigned another generation of women to lower pay. Their proposal to rely only on voluntary business action on pay isn't just naive, it sends a dangerous signal that tackling discrimination against women is a choice, not a requirement.\"\nYvette Cooper, Featherstone's shadow minister on the Labour benches, called the news \"another broken promise from the government\" and said that \"scrapping Labour's plan to increase transparency in pay is a backwards step for women's equality.\""}

The policy has been the cause of protests across the United Kingdom by students, some of which have turned violent. It has also been a source of considerable criticism and political difficulties for the Liberal Democrats and has raised questions as to the long-term viability of the Coalition government.\nThe new policy on tuition fees will allow universities to double the current tuition fees from 3,290 per year to around 6,000 per year, as well as allowing some universities to get special approval from the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) to raise their fees to 9,000 per year. If passed, the new fee structure will apply starting in the academic year of 2012/2013. The vote on Thursday will only be on the fee rise, with other matters being voted on in the new year following publication of a new higher education white paper.\nIn addition to increasing fees, the policy will increase the payment threshold at which payment is made. It is currently set at 15,000 and will rise to 21,000, but the interest rate will also rise. It is currently 1.5% but will now vary from between 0% and 3% plus inflation (using the Retail Price Index).\nThe fee increase follows the publication of an independent review by Lord Browne, former chief executive of BP, a process started by Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary. Before the election, two main options were mooted for funding reform in higher education: either an increase in tuition fees or a graduate tax. The Browne Review endorsed the former and the findings of the Review form the basis of the government's policy. The graduate tax was supported by the Liberal Democrats before the election, and in the Labour leadership elections it was supported by Ed Balls and the winner of the leadership election, Ed Milliband.\nConservative members of the Coalition intend to vote for the reform, and the Labour opposition have been vociferous critics of the rise in fees, despite the previous government's introduction of top-up fees. The Liberal Democratic members of the Coalition have been left in a politically difficult position regarding the fee hike and have been target of much criticism from protesters. Liberal Democrats have opposed the rise in tuition fees: their party manifesto included a commitment to ending tuition fees within six years, and many signed a pledge organised by the National Union of Students to not vote for any increase in tuition fees.\nThe Coalition agreement allows Liberal Democrats to opt to abstain on votes for a number of policies including tuition fees. Many Liberal Democrats are expected to abstain, and a few MPs have stated that they will vote against it including former party leader Sir Menzies Campbell, and the recently elected party president Tim Farron, as well as a number of Liberal Democrat back-benchers. Liberal Democrat party leaders have said that they will act collectively, but the BBC have said senior Liberal Democrats have admitted in private that government whips will not be able to force all Liberal Democrats to vote for the policy.\nOn Tuesday, the Liberal Democrats parliamentary party will meet in the Commons to decide on their collective position. If all ministers decide to vote for the policy, it will probably pass, but if only cabinet ministers (and maybe parliamentary private secretaries) vote for the policy, there is considerable risk of it not passing. If the Coalition does not manage to get the policy through Parliament, it will fuel doubts about the continued effectiveness and viability of the government.\nHow deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and business secretary Vince Cable vote has been of considerable controversy. Although under the Coalition agreement, they are allowed to abstain, suggestions of doing so have prompted criticism. It was suggested last week that Cable may abstain even though as business secretary he is directly responsible for higher education policy, and has been heavily involved in designing the proposals. Cable has said that Liberal Democrat support of the tuition fee changes has allowed them to push it in a more \"progressive\" direction.\nCable has now decided that he will vote for the policy, and argues that the policy has \"a lot of protection for students from low income backgrounds and graduates who have a low income or take time out for family\". He also believes \"there's common consensus that the system we've devised is a progressive one\".\n\"Dr Cable has performed so many U-turns over the issue of university funding that he is spinning on his heels,\" said National Union of Students president Aaron Porter. \"That may stand him in good stead with the Strictly Come Dancing judges but the electorate will see it differently.\"\nFormer deputy prime minister John Prescott joked on Twitter that \"On tuition fees we've noticed Vince Cable's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from stalling to Mr In Between\"a reference to a previous attack Prescott made on Gordon Brown as having transformed from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\".\nOn Question Time this week, Liberal Democrat treasury secretary Danny Alexander also confirmed he is prepared to vote for the policy but delegated the question to the meeting of Liberal Democrats on Tuesday.\nThe politics of the tuition fee debate may also affect the by-election taking place in Oldham East and Saddleworth following the removal of Phil Woolas, where Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates will both be standing for the first by-election following the formation of the Coalition government.\nOpposition to the policy has become the focus for a large number of protests across the country by both current university students, many school pupils and political allies of the student movement.\nOn November 10, between 30,000 and 52,000 protesters from across Britain marched through central London in a demonstration organised by the National Union of Students and the University and College Union, which represents teachers and lecturers in further and higher education. At the November 10 protest, a number of people occupied Millbank Tower, an office block which houses the Conservative Party. Fifty people were arrested and fourteen were injured. NUS president Aaron Porter condemned the attack and said it was caused by \"those who are here to cause trouble\", and that the actions of a \"minority of idiots\" shouldn't \"undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest\".\nFollowing the November 10 march, other protests have taken place across the country including an occupation at the University of Manchester, a sit-in at the John Owens Building in Manchester, and a demonstration at the University of Cambridge. A protest was also run outside the offices of The Guardian where Nick Cleggwho was giving a lecture inside the buildingwas executed in effigy while students protested \"Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning blue\" (blue is the colour of the Conservative Party).\nOn November 24, a large number of protests took place across the country including a mass walk-out from universities and schools organised on Facebook, numerous university occupations, and demonstrations in Manchester, Cambridge, Birmingham, Leeds, Brighton and Cardiff, and a well-publicised occupation of University College London.\nIn London, a protest was planned to march down Whitehall to Parliament, but police held protesters in Trafalgar Square until they eventually broke free and ran around in a game of \"cat and mouse\" along the side streets around Charing Cross Road, Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus.\nSimon Hardy from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts described the police response including the controversial 'kettling' of protesters as \"absolutely outrageous\". Green MP Caroline Lucas raised the police response including the use of kettling in the House of Commons and stated that it was \"neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective\".\nOn November 30, protests continued in London culminating in 146 arrests of protesters in Trafalgar Square, and protests in Cardiff, Cambridge, Newcastle, Bath, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol. Protesters in Sheffield attempted to invade and occupy Nick Clegg's constituency office. Occupations of university buildings started or continued at University College London, Newcastle University, Cambridge University and Nottingham University, as well as council buildings in Oxford and Birmingham.\nA \"day of action\" is being planned on December 8, the day before the Commons vote, by the National Union of Students."}

Bates, United States federal judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, wrote in his opinion that the lawsuit was a \"unique and extraordinary case\" which brought up questions over whether the government had the authority to strategize over killing its own citizens without a previous criminal justice process undertaken. Judge Bates ruled for the United States Department of Justice, and held that various civil rights organizations in addition to Awlaki's father did not have the authority or jurisdiction to start the lawsuit in the first place.\nAwlaki's father was supported in the case by two civil rights organizations, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union. In the lawsuit these organizations argued before the court that targeted killing of an individual who does not present an imminent threat of life to citizens is not permitted by international law or by the United States Constitution. Awlaki was born in New Mexico. Yemeni law enforcement officials in November charged Awlaki with connections to Al-Qaeda, and ordered him to be arrested \"by any means possible\".\nU.S. officials have identified Awlaki as an influential leader within the Islamist terrorist  organization Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Awlaki has made statements where he encouraged individuals of Muslim faith to murder U.S. citizens. According to Associated Press, Awlaki is located in Yemen. He has been linked to terrorist incidents in the United States including the Fort Hood shooting, the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253, and the Cargo planes bomb plot.\nAP reported that it received confirmation from Obama administration officials that, \"al-Awlaki is on a capture or kill list\"; and Agence France-Presse received similar statements from U.S. representatives. However, during the actual process of the Awlaki lawsuit in court, government representatives refused to confirm or deny whether this was the case. The U.S. government put forth the notion during the case that the court did not have jurisdiction to review actions of the President of the United States, due to the fact that the President's choices are intended in a setting of war to prevent the loss of lives of U.S. citizens stemming from acts of terrorism.\nJudge Bates wrote a decision which consisted of 83-pages. He was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. In his ruling, Judge Bates stated, \"The serious issues regarding the merits of the alleged authorization of the targeted killing of a U.S. citizen overseas must await another day or another nonjudicial forum.\" He wrote that the lawsuit brought up, \"vital considerations of national security and of military and foreign affairs\", including how the President is able to order targeted killing of terrorists who are United States citizens, without \"any form of judicial process whatsoever, based on the mere assertion that he is a dangerous member of a terrorist organization.\"\nThe court responded to Awlaki's father's assertions that his son was unable to initiate a lawsuit himself or acquire legal assistance \"without disclosing his whereabouts and exposing himself to possible attack by [U.S. government]\". Judge Bates replied, \"Anwar Al-Aulaqi has made clear that he has no intention of making himself available for criminal prosecution in U.S. courts, remarking in a May 2010 AQAP video interview that he 'will never surrender' to the United States, and that '[i]f the Americans want me, [they can] come look for me.'\""}

In comparison to last year, petrol is more expensive by 11.88p, according to The Automobile Association (AA). The price for 50 litres has therefore increased by 5.94. \nEdmund King, current president of the AA, stated: \"In the past week, we have seen the average price of petrol shoot up 1.7p a litre across the UK and diesel rise 1.61p. It comes at a particularly bad time for drivers, who have struggled with appalling winter weather and often seen their fuel drain away while stuck in snow-bound traffic jams. Our only hope is that either oil and fuel markets settle back down or the pound strengthens against the dollar. Until then, it is an even more uncomfortable ride for families trying to keep cars on the road.\"\niAt 125.73p a litre on average, diesel is approximately eight pence lower than its July 2008 peak of 133.25p; It remains 14.21p more expensive than last year.\nIn January 2011, the prices of fuel are anticipated to rise again due to the increased value added tax rate and higher hydrocarbon oil duty prices coming into effect. Adrian Tink, a motoring strategist for the RAC, believes that the latter should be called off: \"It's unbelievable to think that, compared with this time last year, petrol is 13p a litre more expensive. That's over 7 more every time you fill up an average tank. While the increases this year have been driven by a number of factors, you can't get away from the fact that we have seen five rises in fuel duty in the past two years  and we're due another one in January, plus a VAT rise. Who knows what the price will be come January 5, 2011? An average of 125p per litre is very feasible.\""}

In the cables dating back as early as January 2004, the embassy reports the military activities could include the construction of a nuclear reactor in or near Minbu, along with \"SAM missiles\" and an underground facility with as many as 300 North Korean military personnel assisting the Burmese military in the construction. Burma is primarily controlled by its military.\nIn the January 2004 cable, a businessman reportedly told the U.S. embassy in Rangoon that \"massive\" barges were bringing in large pieces of equipment to  Minbu from the Irawaddy River. He suggested that \"the quantities involved as well as the diameter of the rebar suggested a project larger than 'factories.'\" In the same cable, the U.S. acknowledges that rumors of a nuclear reactor being constructed in the area date back to 2002, with suspected Russian involvement. \"Rumors of ongoing construction of a nuclear reactor are surprisingly consistent and observations of activity such as that described [sic] appear to be increasing,\" said Martinez, the reported cable author. According to a news report in March, The Irrawaddy claims Burma was close to completing at least three nuclear reactors. The country's leadership claims the nuclear research that is taking place is to be used for peaceful purposes.\nIn August of the same year, the U.S embassy receives more information that North Korea military is assisting in the construction of \"SAM missiles (surface to air missiles) of unknown origin\" and an \"underground, concrete reinforced\" facility in Minbu. The construction allegedly includes buildings which would house at least \"20 Burmese army battalions that will be posted near the site.\" The correspondent again says that the report \"tracks with other information Embassy Rangoon and others have reported in various channels.\"\n\"This account is perhaps best considered alongside other information of various origins indicating the Burmese and North Koreans are up to something. Something of a covert military or military-industrial nature. Exactly what, and on what scale, remains to be determined,\" said McMullen, the reported cable author. He also admits that the number of North Koreans thought to be assisting the Burmese military \"is much higher than our best estimates of North Koreans in Burma.\" According to the Agence France-Presse in 2002, citing an unnamed U.S State Department official, the U.S. warned Burma not to pursue a nuclear program saying  that it expects Burma \"to live up to its obligations [under the non-proliferation treaty] and to not pursue production of weapons grade fissile material.\" However a 2008 cable says that Burma may already be in possession of weapons grade uranium. The cable reports that a civilian tried to sell 2,000 kilograms of uranium-238 which \"could be dug up\" from the ground at a site in Kayah State. Uranium-238 could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons.\n\"A Burmese civilian met with members of USDAO [United States Defense Attach Office] Rangoon and offered to sell Uranium-238. The individual had initially contacted the USDAO eight days prior with the offer. The individual provided a small bottle half-filled with metallic powder and a photocopied certificate of testing from a Chinese university dated 1992 as verification of the radioactive nature of the powder,\" said the cable. \"The individual claimed to be able to provide up to 2000 kg of uranium-bearing rock from a location in Kayah State, and further stated if the U.S. was not interested in purchasing the uranium, he and his associates would try to sell it to other countries, beginning with Thailand,\" it added. The cable adds that the Burmese government was unaware that such a transaction was taking place and that they \"would likely seize any additional samples or stocks of the material if aware of their existence.\" However, a cable in January of 2007 says that the Burmese military may have received a shipment of uranium at the end of that month. The \"sensitive shipment\" was said to have come from Singapore via shipping freighter.\n\"[An unnamed witness] claimed that metals are usually exported in blocks, whereas the bags in this shipment were filled with loose earth and mud. The source of the mixed ore, Maw Chi, is also a source for uranium, they claimed. Security was tighter than usual, surveillance was heavier, and officials paid closer attention to the movement of the shipment and activity at the port,\" said the cable. The cable author, 'Villarosa,' later states that the embassy in Rangoon was given allegedly detailed information on the shipping methods, weight and cost. No further cables have yet to be released on the matter."}

He also added that the government remains \"concerned\" about the situation and \"unauthorised and irresponsible distribution of classified material.\"\nControversy had also been raised today after Julia Gillard changed her stance on the release of the cables from calling the action \"illegal,\" to calling it \"grossly irresponsible,\" after the AFP had released their findings. Ms Gillard said at a press-conference in Sydney today that she did not intend to say that the release of the cables was illegal, but that their theft was. Deputy leader of the opposition (Liberal Party) Julie Bishop said there was no room for Ms Gillard to \"weasel out of it.\"\n\"She is a lawyer. She well knows about the presumption of innocence,\" said Bishop. She added that the prime minister's legal background did not warrant her comments. Calls have also been voiced by the Green's Senator, Scott Ludlam, for Ms Gillard to retract her comments.\nWikileaks has been the subject of past investigations in Australia. In March of 2009, the proposed Australian Communications and Media Authority internet blacklist was leaked to the website. That matter was also referred to the AFP, who later abandoned pursuing criminal charges.\n\"It's my understanding from the AFP that they considered the prospects of success under their guidelines, but it wasn't sufficient to get a prosecution,\" said Chairman Chris Chapman during a Senate Estimates Committee meeting in February.

His most famous album, Trout Mask Replica (1969) melded free jazz, blues-rock, and avant-garde styles to create a critically acclaimed (albeit commercially unsuccessful) work. He retired from music in 1982 to focus on painting.\nWhilst none of the albums released by Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, including 1967 debut album Safe as Milk, were commercially successful, his work is regularly cited as highly influential.

Stephen Griffiths, 40, who attracted tabloid attention by calling himself the \"Crossbow Cannibal\", killed the prostitutes in his flat in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England and will spend the rest of his life behind bars.\nGriffiths, a former van driver with a degree in psychology and studying for a PhD in criminology, was caught when police were alerted to a murder caught on CCTV. A caretaker, reviewing footage from the building where Griffiths's flat is, saw Suzanne Blamires, 36, and Griffiths enter the flat. Two minutes later, she ran out and he followed, beating her to the ground and shooting her in the head with a crossbow. He raised his crossbow above his head for the CCTV, then dragged the body away. Returning with a drink, he raised the can and one finger to the camera.\nOver the course of a weekend, he was seen several times with bin bags and a rucksack. After Griffiths was arrested by armed police on May 24, her dismembered remains were found floating the the River Ayre near Shipley; her head was in a rucksack and it was yesterday revealed a crossbow bolt and broken knife were embedded in it. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said she was in 81 pieces. \nSmith added that Griffiths confessed to killing her and cutting her up by hand; he had previously used power tools on his victims. Shelley Armitage, 31, had been missing since April when police charged Griffiths; a piece of spine in the River Ayre was later identified as hers. Also found by the river was a suitcase containing knives and saws.\nIt was yesterday revealed her murder was also on video. Griffiths recorded the act on his mobile, which he then lost on a train. Its finder sold it on twice before police retrieved it, but the footage remained. Armitage is seen hogtied on cushions, the words \"My Sex Slave\" spray-painted in black on her back. She is also seen dead and naked in his bathtub. \"I am Ven Pariah, I am the Bloodbath Artist,\" Griffiths said as part of a commentary to the video. \"Heres a model who is assisting me.\"\nThe third murder - that of Susan Rushworth, 43 - dates back to June last year, when she vanished. Although police believe she was killed with a hammer and Griffiths has spoken of the death, no remains were ever found and the only physical evidence was one bloodstain in her killer's flat. Police found evidence he tried to clean up, with bathroom tiles removed and carpets lifted. \n\"It was just a slaughterhouse in the bathtub,\" he told police at interview. He later confessed to police that \"I, or part of me, is responsible for killing Susan Rushworth, Shelley Armitage and Suzanne Blamires, who I know as Amber.\" Two crossbows, crossbow bolts, and serial killer literature were seized from his flat.\nThe day before the final murder, Griffiths wrote on MySpace, using the Ven Pariah pseudonym, he had \"finally emerged into the world.\" He continued: \"What will this pseudo-human do, one wonders. Poor Stephen, pretended to be me, but he was only the wrapping. He knew towards the end, that I supplied the inner core of iron. Hatred Bound Tightly In Flesh. At very long last, the time has come to act out.\" He would later tell officers he was having a mental \"civil war\".\nHe told the magistrates' court on his first appearance his name was \"The Crossbow Cannibal.\" Yesterday, he was asked at Leeds Crown Court merely to confirm his name, answering \"yes\". Each murder charge was read to him, and he answered \"guilty\" to each. Five security guards flanked him. He has also called himself the SF killer. Although he claimed to have boiled and eaten flesh from the first two victims and eaten the third raw, police could not verify this. The Telegraph says the suspect he invented it to increase his fame, but News Limited quotes Sky News as claiming police believed his cannibalistic claims.\nMr Justice Openshaw, the judge, yesterday called Griffiths \"wicked and monstrous.\" He told the court the killer's mental health had been investigated and there is \"no question that he [i]s fit to plead.\" He gave Griffiths the whole life tariff, meaning he will never be released.\nGriffiths has attempted suicide while in prison awaiting trial, and police have not yet established if he killed three more women, as he told officers his count stood at six.\nAt the time Griffiths was charged, Nicky Blamires, 54, has told the press her daughter Suzanne was a \"much-loved\" family member even though she \"went down the wrong path and did not have the life she was meant to have.\" \"Nobody deserves this,\" she said. \"All these girls were human beings and people's daughters.\"\nGriffiths was known as \"the lizard man\" in his block of flats owing to his habit of walking his two pet monitor lizards in the area. One neighbour is reported to have quoted him as saying he was studying for \"a PhD in murder and Jack the Ripper,\" and he has spent time in a high-security psychiatric hospital.\nBritish media was quick to compare the case to Peter Sutcliffe, dubbed the \"Yorkshire Ripper\".

At 1:12 p.m., Jung called emergency services, saying, \"This girl's just not waking up.\" When asked if she was breathing, Jung responded with, \"We don't know. It's dark back there. I'm gonna get a light and try and see.\" At 1:26 p.m., Martin was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency workers. Law enforcement officials said the room was dark because there were blackout \"curtains drawn in the bedroom.\"\nAn autopsy on Martin's body did not find any trauma-related injuries, and the official cause of death has not been established by investigators. A toxicology report, expected to take several weeks, will likely be used to determine the reason Martin died. Police said Martin's body did not exhibit any \"apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death.\" According to her ex-husband, Adrienne Martin had a rare heart condition, called Long QT syndrome, which can cause palpitations and sudden cardiac death. Kevin Martin said his ex-wife never sought medical advice on her condition and did not talk about it with friends.\nPolice said that Busch was home at the US$2 million mansion when Martin was discovered, and that the ongoing investigation is being handled by the Frontenac Police Department and the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office.

He was indicted on six separate counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, as well as four additional charges: mail fraud, unlawfully keeping national defense information, obstruction of justice, and unauthorized conveyance of government property. Sterling, aged 43, had been employed by the CIA from May 1993 until he was fired in January 2002. During his arraignment, a judge declared that he would be held until a Monday hearing because the government called him a danger to the community.\nSterling, an African American lawyer who lives in O'Fallon, allegedly provided classified information to New York Times reporter James Risen, some of which was incorporated into Risen's 2006 State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Risen, who wrote about the CIA's involvement in Iran's nuclear program, has not named any of his sources even after being subpeonaed twice; Risen was not explicitly named in Sterling's indictment, but his involvement in the alleged leak is strongly supported by its contents, and a US government official confirmed the connection to NBC News.\nThe indictment stated that, for two years during his career with the CIA, Sterling had been involved in \"a classified clandestine operational program designed to conduct intelligence activities related to the weapons capabilities of certain countries.\" An anonymous source close to the investigation said one of those countries was Iran. While managing CIA operations, Sterling also handled a \"human asset,\" whose name he is also accused of releasing.\nFrom 2000, Sterling had been engaged in various disputes with the agency. According to a story authored by Risen for The New York Times in March 2002, Sterling's supervisor during the Iran program said, \"You kind of stick out as a big black guy.\" The comment was made after Sterling made requests for new assignments concerning Iran, requests declined because his appearance could interfere with the cases. Sterling, sued the CIA  for racial discrimination shortly after being fired, but was unable to come to a settlement in February 2003, and allegedly began leaking the classified information soon after that. The indictment claimed the motive behind the leak was retaliation for the unsuccessful lawsuit.\nEdward B. MacMahon Jr., a Virginia attorney for Sterling, said, \"He has always maintained his innocence throughout the course of this entire investigation. We'll seek to prove that in court.\" MacMahon also said trial will be held at a U.S. District Court in Alexandria, as the case began in that state. Every charge against Sterling comes with the possibility of 1020 years of jail time.\nUS Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer made a statement, saying that \"Sterling placed at risk our national security and the life of an individual working on a classified mission.\" A spokesperson for the CIA said, \"Separate and apart from any specific instance, including this matter involving a former agency officer who left the CIA years ago, we take very seriously the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\" The New York Times did not comment on the matter.\nThe Obama administration has already taken action in several similar leaks involving government officers.

The plot has caused the largest number of complaints to be made about the show since it was first broadcast in 1985.\nCampaigners attempting to raise awareness of SIDS criticised the plot. Anne Diamond, a television presenter and one of those campaigners, remarked that the exchange of the babies was a \"crass twist to an otherwise credible storyline\" and said that not \"one iota of good in educating a young audience about cot death\" had been achieved by it.\nDue to the complaints received, the BBC have made the decision to end this storyline earlier than originally scheduled, during the spring of 2011. Bryan Kirkwood, the current executive producer of EastEnders, has disclosed that, at the end of this storyline, the baby, named Tommy, will remeet Kat Moon, his mother. \nKirkwood said that this storyline, like many others in the BBC One programme, approaches \"social issues in a powerful and dramatic way\". He also explained: \"Although we have had complaints we have also had positive responses from people who have been through the experiences we are currently dramatising who feel we've done this and have contacted us to offer their backing.\n\"Whenever we embark on a story at EastEnders we always leave it open-ended to monitor and listen to audience reaction,\" he continued. \"With this in mind we are going to bring the story to a close on screen in the spring.

She stressed that \"[t]he show is absolutely not suggesting that this behaviour is typical of a mother who has suffered such a terrible and tragic loss.\n\"Taking Kat's baby is the action of a character in great distress due to a series of events that have befallen her in the last 18 months,\" Bennett explained. \"It is the culmination of these that has driven her to this one moment of madness rather than as a direct result of the loss of her baby. The issues of grief caused by the loss of a child and sudden infant death syndrome more generally are sensitively handled. EastEnders has a long history of tackling difficult issues in a way that allows viewers to learn and debate the topic at hand.\"\nOn Thursday, Samantha Womack denied that this storyline was the reason for her leaving the programme. She has mentioned that her departure had already been arranged with producers of the programme for a few months.\nBefore this incident occurred, the record for the highest number of complaints for EastEnders was a storyline in April 2009 that involved Danielle Jones being killed as the result of a car collision.

The move means the end of rival company AT&T's status as the only official US carrier of the iPhone, a status it held since the first iPhone debuted in 2007.\nThe press conference, held in New York City, was hosted by Verizon's president, Lowell McAdam, Apple's chief operating officer, Tim Cook, and Verizon Wireless' chief executive officer, Dan Mead. Neither Verizon Communications CEO Ivan Seidenberg nor Apple CEO Steve Jobs attended the conference. During the event, McAdam said, \"If the press writes something long enough and hard enough, it eventually comes true.

The \"Verizon iPhone,\" as it has been dubbed for months, has been altered from the original iPhone 4 so it can utilize Verizon's 3G CDMA (code division multiple access) network. This means, however, that Verizon iPhone users will not be able to use the company's 4G LTE (long term evolution) network, and will thus be unable to make calls and access the Internet at the same time. Cook told the audience that the LTE hardware was not ready yet, saying, \"The first generation LTE chip sets force some design compromises, some of which we would not make. Secondlyand most importantlyVerizon Wireless customers have told us they want the iPhone now.\" However, Verizon's iPhone 4 allows the user to create a personal Wi-Fi hotspot, which means up to five other wireless devices can connect to the Internet through the phone.\nPricing was announced as US$199 for a 16 GB version and US$299 for a 32 GB version, both requiring two-year contractsthe same cost for an AT&T iPhone 4. However, Verizon said it would not mention the cost of data plans at this time, with Mead saying, \"We talked about the device pricing, but we're not going to talk about the pricing for the network for that connectivity.\""}

Nejloveanu, 23, was also convicted of a series of rapes and headed the business with guidance from his 51-year-old father.\nFive women were lured from Romania, the youngest in her teens, the oldest 27, with promises of work and romance with Marius. Originally founding a brothel in their hometown of Birmingham, the pair met resistance from local rival pimps and relocated the women to Manchester. There, they worked six or seven days each week, sleeping in brothels and having sex with eight-to-ten men each night against their will. \nTypical fees from customers were around 40 but some may have paid as low as 10. Around half of each fee went to the Nejloveanus and half to the brothel. Police launched raids, rescuing the women after receiving a tip-off.\nBogdan was accused by Rachel Smyth, prosecuting, of giving advice and assistance to Marius; Smyth opened the trial last year telling Manchester Crown Court \"[h]aving heard the evidence you [the jury] may conclude that the son, Marius, learnt this trade from his father and that this was a family business.\" The woman were \"threatened, beaten and degraded\" and faced \"extreme sexual violence and humiliation,\" the court heard.\nBogdan was convicted of seven offences - three counts of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, three counts of trafficking into the UK for sexual exploitation and controlling prostitution for gain.

Centres in Newport and Glasgow were picketed by members Thursday and Friday mornings as part of a coordinated strike at seven of the thirty centres handling benefits and unemployment-related queries for the UK public.\nWikinews spoke to Katrine Williams, one of the representatives of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and a member of the Civil Service since 1991, to establish the grievances leading to the public-sector industrial action.\nBalloted in December, over 70% of PCS members voted in favour of strike action; according to Williams, this forced minor concessions from call centre management, but left staff being constantly monitored. With a target of five minutes or less to handle any query related to Job-Seekers' Allowance, staff have been threatened with disciplinary action should they take too long for calls. Williams expressed concern that, with many claimants, it took longer than this to simply establish what the issue was for a member of the public calling in.\nThe number provided for the public to call in relation to benefits is an 0845 number, usually charged at a local call rate when dialled from a landline within the UK; for many claimants, they may only have a mobile phone and be subject to higher charges, or even in a position where a benefit payment has been delayed, and this is their sole contact with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) when they may be in financial difficulty.\nBoth Williams and David Coventry, who spoke to the UK Press Association, feel let down that their members' expertise is being dismissed; that what is the only option for the unemployed, and a public service, is being managed as-if a commercial enterprise. This, according to Williams, is the prevalent attitude for approximately ten years; managers previously in the private-sector constantly describe the service as a \"business\", and members of the public requiring assistance as \"customers\".\nIn describing negotiations with management to avert industrial action, Williams stated: \"contact centre managers are [the] worst [within the DWP]\", and they, \"renege on verbal agreements\".\nThe centres hit by strike action are: Bristol, Glasgow, Makerfield near Wigan, Manchester, Newport, Norwich, and Sheffield. Williams stated that a failure on the government's part to resolve the dispute could lead to further action involving the full 30 call centres operated by the DWP. In combination with threats of action by passport office staff in the PCS union, the UK's current coalition government may be faced with significant disruption to essential public services at a time when unemployment figures are climbing.\nWhen Wikinews contacted the DWP press office, only a prepared statement was available. Forwarded to Wikinews by Elise Simpson, the department expressed disappointment at industrial action being taken by staff, stating: \"only 21% across the centres\" were taking action. Appeals for further clarification, and answers to other queries were not returned. Considering the union selectively took action at seven of thirty centres, it would appear the walk-out at those was virtually all staff. Calls to the Jobseekers' 0845 number gave no indication calls may take longer to be connected to someone able to assist with a query or claim.\nIn late December, Brendan Barber of the Trades Union Congress warned that 2011 may be a year where the UK faces widespread public-sector industrial action. 81 billion (US$128 billion) is set to be cut from the UK's expenditure, with the possible loss of over a quarter million public-sector jobs."}

There are so many occasions when he had me laughing helplessly. But what some people may not appreciate is the lyrics to his songs were incredible.

Proclaimer Craig Reid said \"Music was Gerry's passion. He said music is something that you have to pass on to other people. You don't own it and it goes through you.

Craig's twin brother Charlie recalled \"Gerry was great for his refusal to sell out and his determination to do his own thing. This man was respected for what he did.\"\nRafferty spent his entire life dealing with alcohol use. Nor was this his only health problem: \"There have  been periods in my life where  I have experienced depression,\" he said in a recent interview. \"It has been through some of my darkest moments that I have written some of my best songs.

Although many European countries manufacture the drug, which is primarily used in Europe as an ansthetic, no manufacturer has been found that is willing to supply it for use in conjunction with the death penalty, the abolition of which has been lobbied by the EU since 2008.\nThe shortage means that executions in California and Oklahoma have been delayed, with Texas' last remaining stocks of the drug due to expire in March, weeks before two scheduled executions.

Anyone earning between the ranges of $50,000 to $100,000 will contribute 0.5 percent of their income whilst anyone earning over $100,000 annually will pay 1 percent.\nDuring her announcement, Gillard stated: \"Under this levy, someone who has an income of $60,000 will pay just under $1 extra per week.

The Government will obtain three billion dollars through the scratching of certain schemes and the postponement of others. The levy will then contribute the other two billion.\nThe bill has not come without criticism. The leader of the opposing Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, has claimed that there is \"fat\" in the budget. He said there should be no requirement for Australians to contribute towards a levy, but rather the government should cut back on its own spending.\nGillard responded to Abbott's claims by saying that the Liberal's proposed paid maternity leave scheme would have required Australian people to pay a levy, and that it is unjustifiable that they then wouldnt allow for the rebuilding of Queensland.\nIndependent Bob Katter has said that until a designated fund for natural disaster relief is established by the Government, he will not approve of any relief levies introduced into parliament. Tony Windsor, a fellow independent, agreed.

{"id": 1728, "ended": true, "text": "U.S. Prohibition Party presidential candidate Jim Hedges of Thompson Township, Pennsylvania took some time to answer a few questions about the Prohibition Party and his 2012 presidential campaign. \nThe Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the United States, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. The party heavily supported the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as Prohibition (191933). It was repealed in 1933.  The party has declined since this period, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.\nIn 2003, the party split into two factions. Preacher Gene Amondson and perennial candidate Earl Dodge were nominated for the presidency by their respective factions. After Dodge's death in 2007, the party reunified and named Amondson as its sole presidential nominee for 2008. During the election, Amondson was interviewed by Wikinews.  He died in 2009, leaving an opening in the party for 2012.\nJim Hedges is a longtime Prohibition activist, who holds the distinction of the first individual of the 21st century (and the first since 1959) to be elected to a political office under the Prohibition Party banner. In 2001, he was elected as the Thompson Township tax assessor, and was re-elected to the post in 2005.  He served until his term expired in 2010. Hedges declared his intent to run for the Prohibition Party presidential nomination on February 18, 2010.  This marks his first run for the presidency.\n((William Saturn))  When and why did you decide to join the Prohibition Party?\n((Jim Hedges)) I have identified with the Prohibition Party since being in high school, in the 1950s.  Being \"a member\" is trickier to specify, as Ive sometimes registered to vote in other parties for temporary pragmatic reasons (or have not been registered, at all). I could not be active in the Party until after I retired from the military, in 1980.\nWhy?  Well, I liked, and still like, the Prohibition platform better than I do the platform of any other political group.  Partly, this is because of the anti-alcohol plank, but more generally because it seems more principled and more reasonable.\n((WS))  You are the first (and only) member of the Prohibition Party to be elected to any office in the 21st century. How were you able to accomplish such a feat?\n((JH)) I ran for an insignificant local office which no one else wanted.  Minor party people are always complaining that they cant get elected  they can, if they start at the beginning instead of aiming at impossible goals.\n((WS))  According to the New York Times, you were heavily involved in the 2004 split of the party that centered around five-time presidential nominee Earl Dodge. What exactly caused the split, and has the party since healed?\n((JH)) To answer the last part first:  It has largely healed.  A few months after Dodge died, his hand-picked vice-chairman also died.  The man who was third in line refused to carry on.   That man, and the Dodge relatives, then dropped out completely; the other folks mostly are now working with the regular organization.\nThe split was caused by dissatisfaction with Dodges management.  Dodge was a somewhat paranoid person who trusted no one to help him.  For  example, he made one of his daughters \"treasurer\" of the Prohibition National Committee, but he did not allow her access to the bank account.  He was the only \"signer\" listed on the check card.   Another example:  He used money from a bequest to purchase a small office condominium, then without telling even his vice-chairman, he mortgaged the condo, cashed it out, and after a time lost it (because the mortgage was not being paid); the vice-chairman discovered all this only after Dodge died.   Dodge could sell the office condo undetected, because he held it in the name of a shell corporation controlled by himself and the said daughter.\n((WS))  The late Gene Amondson, the 2004 & 2008 presidential nominee of the Prohibition Party was the national face of the party for a number of years. How well did you know Mr. Amondson, and what is the current state of the party with his absence?\n((JH)) I met Amondson at a couple of conventions; otherwise, I knew him only from correspondence and from telephone calls.  \nAmondson was a congenial person, warm and approachable.  He was recommended to us by one of our supporters.  He had an act, a re-creation of Rev. Billy Sundays sermon on booze, which he performed at conservative churches and other sympathetic venues.  We hoped that his name recognition and the audience appeal of his act would enhance the Partys appeal.\nAs it turned out, he had a handicap, analogous to dyslexia, which prevented him from stringing words together into fluent sentences.  His act was great.  His public speaking and his writing were, um, unremarkable.\nWe miss his ability to attract attention to us.\n((WS))  Mr. Amondson stated that \"Prohibition was America's greatest 13 years\" and that he would \"rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store\". Do you agree with these comments, and additionally, do you second his projection that \"Prohibition will come again for the fourth time\"? \n((JH)) I expect that national prohibition will come again \"someday,\" because nothing we've tried since then has worked as well in reducing per-capita consumption of alcoholic beverages and the related social problems.\nThe rest of that is campaign hyperbole. \n((WS))  Why did you choose to run for president and what are your qualifications?\n((JH)) Its partly a \"finger-in-the-dike\" tactic, because I see no one else in the organization who has the free time and the personal background needed to mount a plausible campaign.  Partly, also, its the realization that, at age 72, if Im ever going to do it, Id better get on with doing it now.\nMany times in the past, the Prohibition Party has recruited presidential candidates from outside its own ranks.  The same may happen again this year.   If not, I see myself as being the most  broadly educated and widely experienced person within the core group of the Party.  \nI have a BA in musical performance (Iowa, 1960) and served 20 years in one of our nations most elite military units, The United States Marine Band.  \nI have a family-farm background, plus 20 years of life in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  I understand both rural and urban communities.\nI have an MA in Geography (Maryland, 1972),  have published research in refereed journals both here and abroad, and for 11 years edited a journal.  \nI have done volunteer work with and served as an officer of community organizations ranging from The Salvation Army to friends of the library to recycling programs to historical and literary clubs.\nI have done newspaper reporting, primarily on local government.\n((WS))  Who are some of your opponents for the nomination and why do you believe you are a better choice for the party?\n((JH)) To my knowledge, no one else has yet expressed an interest in the Prohibition Party nomination.\n((WS))  When and where will the party hold their convention, and how will a nominee be decided upon?\n((JH)) Cullman, Alabama, in June.  See the National Committee's website for details. \nA vote of the  credentialed delegates will determine who is the candidate.\n((WS))  Do you agree with the decision to allow prominent Libertarian Stephen P. Gordon to speak at the convention, despite his support for the sale of alcohol?\n((JH)) Yes.  First of all, the Prohibition Party and the Libertarian Party share some common interests, such as small government, balanced budgets, and personal freedoms.  Secondly, we should all take time to listen to those who disagree with us, in order to sharpen our debating skills.  Thirdly, we shouldnt be complacent, because... we might actually be wrong!\n((WS))  According to the Ballot Access News, the Prohibition Party has qualified for the ballot in only Florida. What will you do to gain ballot access in other states?\n((JH)) Most likely, we will be able to meet the ballot requirements in only 2 or 3 states in addition to Florida (which has among the most lenient ballot access regulations today).    Colorado is a likely one, as are Mississippi and Louisiana.  \nFor small parties, the states where they run has very little to do with where they have the most support and very much to do with which states have the easiest regulations.\n((WS))  What issues or policy stances form the basis of your campaign?\n((JH)) Inasmuch as beverage alcohol is our signature issue, I anticipate spending most of my time talking about the alcohol connection with various social problems:  public safety, public health, taxes, homelessness, spouse abuse,  child welfare, military preparedness, industrial efficiency, product quality, and so forth.\nThe platform most likely will address a lot of other things, but, lets face it:  The Prohibition Party today is an exercise in living history.  Were like the weekend warriors who put on costumes and re-enact the Civil War.  The South is not going to rise again.  Neither is national prohibition going to come back (not, at least, in our lifetimes).  But in both cases, we think there are important historical lessons which ought not be forgotten.  And so, we soldier on against all odds.\nUnless we stay on the message (of alcohol), our living history lesson will be lost.  \n((WS))  Have you received any notable endorsements thus far?\n((JH)) No.  Neither have I sought any.  \n((WS))  According to Weekend America, Vice-Presidential nominee Leroy Pletten was incapacitated following a stroke during the 2008 campaign. Have you chosen a running mate, and if not, will health be a factor in the decision?\n((JH)) The Public Radio announcement appears to be a case of mistaken identity.  I have checked with Pletten, and no such thing happened.\nIve been asking around.  I know who Id like to have, but its still under discussion.\nHealth should enter into it.  We dont need another Reagan!\n((WS))  How often do you campaign, and how might that change should you win the nomination?\n((JH)) Very little campaigning, at this point.  I sent out a series of monthly postcards last year, presenting myself to the people on the Party mailing list.  There is also a (very rudimentary) campaign website  www.hedges4-12.com  Im in touch with the people who will make the decision, at the Convention this coming June.\nIf I should receive the nomination, the website will have to be improved, and there will have to be press releases and some personal visits to states where we get on the ballot.  Ill have to obtain advice on making more effective use of the internet. \n((WS))  Describe a typical day for Jim Hedges. How do you spend your time?\n((JH)) Before going to sleep each evening, I map out the following day in my mind.  Then, in the morning, I roll out (not too early), tend to personal care and a hearty breakfast, go to the other house (when my wife and I were married, 20 years ago, we each had a paid-for house, and it was convenient to keep both of them)  and tend to the pets.  The rest of the morning is spent dealing with paper mail and other clerical work.  In warm weather, afternoons are devoted to yard work and to gardening; in cold weather, I do household maintenance chores, work in the shop, work on the wood pile.  After supper, if there is not a rehearsal or a concert to go to, I practice half an hour on my tuba, then look at the internet or read.\nEvery day is different, but thats the basic schedule.\n((WS))  What is your main source for political news?\n((JH)) Three weekly newsmagazines:  The Economist, The Nation, and Science.   \n((WS))  What is your biggest political concern at the moment?\n((JH)) In the next 10 years, eliminating governmental deficits, primarily in the United States and in Europe.  In the next 100 years, dealing with the social and economic consequences of the rise in sea level due to climatic warming.\n((WS))  How would you assess the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama?\n((JH)) Bush the Younger was unquestionably the most damaging president since FDR, perhaps the most damaging of all time:  His \"Patriot Act\" and other security measures trashed the Constitution, our Constitution.  His deficits have never been equaled.  His foreign military adventures are the longest wars ever fought by our country.  \nObama was dealt a miserable hand, but even so, Im becoming disappointed.  We still have Bushs deficit spending.  We still have Bushs wars.  We still have Bushs failure to secure the border with Mexico.  We still have Bushs exporting American jobs overseas.  What is there to like?\nObama did end Bushs \"global gag rule,\" which attempted to prevent family planning agencies all over the world from even discussing abortion.  And he did make a stab at improving medical care.\n((WS))  What are your thoughts on Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Movement?\n((JH)) Palin was given a job for four years by the voters of Alaska.  When she got bored with it, she handed the office key to her lieutenant governor and walked away.  Thats not responsible behavior.\nThe Tea Party folks are on the right track in trying to get the federal budget deficit under control.  I fear, though, that they lack the patience and flexibility to do the job gracefully.   And, theyre too easily distracted by unrelated issues.\n((WS))  What is your take on the the health care bill?\n((JH)) Obamacare is a step in the right direction, but it leaves intact the private insurance industry, which is a major source of waste.  We need a public health service, like the one in England.\n((WS))  What are some of your foreign policy views?\n((JH)) America first! Our unqualified support for Israel is doing us a great deal of damage elsewhere in the world.  We need to stop all aid, both civilian and military, to Israel until Israel abides by the Oslo Accords.\nWe need to stop being the worlds bully and, instead, lead by example:  ratify Kyoto, ratify CEDAW, rein in the international corporations.  \n((WS))  What historical or contemporary figures do you identify with?\n((JH)) You know, I think it would be appropriate to name Jimmy Carter.  I didnt always agree with what he did, but I could sympathize with why he did it.  To the extent that any president can be, he was an honest, well-meaning person.  \nLook at the things he has done since leaving the White House, then look at the things other presidents have done after their terms ended.  Carter has continued to serve the American people, and the world, while the others have hied themselves to their clubs and estates, to their lecture circuits and their corporate boards.  \nYes, I would like to be a person such as Jimmy Carter."}

Analysts have, however, suggested little had changed within the government; many positions, they say, are filled with military figures.\nIn a statement broadcast on state media in Egypt, the army said: \"To the great people of Egypt, your armed forces, acknowledging the legitimate rights of the people ... have not and will not use force against the Egyptian people.\" A BBC correspondent in Cairo said the announcement meant it \"now seems increasingly likely that the 30-year rule of Mr Mubarak is drawing to a close.\"\n\"The presence of the army in the streets is for your sake and to ensure your safety and wellbeing.

Today there have been protests in Suez, Mansoura, Damanhour, and Alexandria.\nSpeaking to news media in the area, many protesters said the new cabinet did little to quell their anger. \"We want a complete change of government, with a civilian authority,\" one said. Another added: \"This is not a new government. This is the same regimethis is the same bluff. [Mubarak] has been bluffing us for 30 years.\"\nIn Tahrir Square today, protesters played music as strings of barbed wire and army tanks stood nearby. Demonstrators scaled light poles, hanging Egyptian flags and calling for an end to Mubarak's rule. \"One poster featured Mubarak's face plastered with a Hitler mustache, a sign of the deep resentment toward the 82-year-old leader they blame for widespread poverty, inflation and official indifference and brutality during his 30 years in power,\" one journalist in the square reported this evening."}

In December 2010, this figure was 3.7%. According to BBC News Online, 4% is the highest CPI that the UK has experienced since November 2008.\nThere are various reasons for the raised British inflation rate, including value added tax (VAT) increasing from 17.5% to 20% on January 4 and the value of crude oil rising. The inflation rate of the Retail Price Index in the country has increased to 5.1%; previously, the value was 4.8%. The CPI has now been a minimum of a percentage point higher than the intended 2% target for one year and two months.\nThe ONS revealed that the price of petrol per litre, which the CPI measured at 1.27 (US$2.04, 1.51) (5.77/ Imperial gallon), was a record peak. The rising values of tobacco, alcohol, hotels, restaurants, transport and furniture are also said to have caused the increase in VAT. Between December 2010 and January 2011, the rate of the CPI increased by 0.1%, the first time that inflation rose during these two months since records commenced in 1997. The ONS have stated that \"[t]wo of the main factors that had an impact on the January data are the increase in the standard rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to 20% and the continued increase in the price of crude oil\".\nMervyn King, the current Governor of the Bank of England, has written  a letter and sent it to George Osborne, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer of the British government. The letter provides an explanation for the inflation outlook and what can be done to overcome it. Within the letter, King states that the inflation is anticipated to increase to 5% within the next few months.\n\"The MPC's central judgement, under the assumption that Bank rate increases in line with market expectations, remains that inflation will fall back so that it is about as likely to be above the target as below it two to three years ahead,\" Mervyn King stated in the letter. \"The MPC judges that attempting to bring inflation back to the target quickly risks generating undesirable volatility in output and would increase the chances of undershooting the target in the medium term.\"\nDuring the last week, the UK interest rates remained at 0.5%. The Bank of England has kept this figure at half a percent for twenty-three consecutive months."}

The BRIT Awards started in 1980; this year's event is the 31st BRIT Awards. ITV1 broadcasted this year's programme from 2000-2200 UTC, with British actor and presenter James Corden hosting it.\nThe ITV1 programme contained performances from various artists, many of which had been nominated for BRIT Awards.

The device, constructed from silicon, absorbs light and dissipates the energy as heat.\nProfessor Hui Cao's researchers were following on from theoretical work last year by Professor Douglas Stone. Stone explained \"we were working on a theory that could predict what could be used to form a laser,\" and the theory also predicted the possibility of an anti-laser. Lasers amplify light to produce coherent pulses.\nThe new anti-laser focuses two identical laser beams towards each other. The light is trapped in an optical cavity and bounces until all the energy is converted into heat. The one constructed by Yale used a piece of silicon 110 micrometers wide; it absorbed 99.4% of light at a wavelength of 998.5 nanometers, which is close to infrared.\nStone felt \"[t]heory and experiment matched very well. We couldn't have expected to do any better.\" The theory suggests that 99.999% could be absorbed, but Yale blamed \"experimental limitations\" for not achieving this. Yale explained that more sophisticated anti-lasers may approach this absorption rate, and added that simulations suggest much smaller versions could be made.\nThe research team believes it could have applications in supercomputing, with machines using light and not electrons like regular computers. Many computer components are already manufactured from silicon. Since the energy is dissipated as heat, however, use is limited against laser weapons since the heat would damage the target anyway.\nGeneral light-absorption is not difficult, according to Stone, but this is the first time a device has been built targeted to the specific-wavelength beams produced by lasers."}

At least 75 people have been killed by collapsing buildings in central Christchurch, with more feared. Mayor Bob Parker said 55 bodies had been identified and there were a further 20 unidentified bodies. The spire of the iconic Anglican ChristChurch Cathedral has fallen and rubble is strewn throughout the central business district. Roads and carparks have cracked and lifted, and two buses are reported to be crushed under the bus exchange. Pools of mud have erupted due to burst water mains and liquefaction.  Boulders and falling cliff faces have destroyed buildings on hillside suburbs.  Fears for the safety of nearby towns Lyttelton and Akaroa are exacerbated due to communication problems.\nThe earthquake was centred near Christchurch, at a depth of five kilometres, according to the United States Geological Survey. Unlike previous quakes in the region that caused no fatalities, Tuesday quake was shallower and closer to the central city and the damage was much worse. Condemned buildings, weakened by last year's widespread earthquakes, were destroyed. Some aftershocks have occurred in the area after the earthquake. The largest so far was a magnitude 5.6 which occurred at 7:04 p.m. February 21 EDT (1:04:18 p.m. local time, February 22). \nMayor Bob Parker has stated that as many as 25 major buildings in the city are destroyed. Urban Search and Rescue efforts are focussed on people trapped in the remains of Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation office buildings. The historic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Christchurch has half collapsed, while the old Canterbury Provincial Chambers building, Piko Wholefoods, and a church on Durham Street have been destroyed.\nThe earthquake also caused an estimated 30 million tons of ice to break off of the Tasman Glacier forming icebergs in a lake near its foot. Tourists on boats at the time of the quake say waves of 3.5 meters swept the lake for at least 30 minutes following the event. The glacier sits on the country's west coast, approximately 120 miles (200km) from Christchurch. No injuries were reported.\nMany people are trapped in damaged buildings or under rubble, but emergency services have been hampered by gridlock as motorists and pedestrians evacuated the CBD. The main hospital remains operational despite one damaged ward being closed, and three triage centres have been set up to provide medical aid. Several hundred delegates attending a medical conference in the city, the great majority from Australia, have been trapped in the city; some of these are assisting with tending to the injured.\nElectricity, telephone services, and traffic lights suffered widespread outages. Orion and Telecom are attempting to assess the damage, and generators have been sent down from Auckland to replace the backup generators in the city. Civil Defence is mounting a response with all available national resources, and Cabinet is holding an emergency session. Speaking to Radio New Zealand, Mayor Bob Parker said he was \"thrown quite a distance\", that there were scenes of \"great confusion\" on the streets, and that the quake was \"as violent as the one that happened on the 4th of September\". The emergency telephone code, 111 was not working for the entire region of Southland, New Zealand but is apparently stable as of approx. 4 pm NZDT. Christchurch Airport is currently closed to all but emergency flights.

Six astronauts, Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Alvin Drew, Nicole Stott, Michael Barratt, and Steve Bowen, are participating in the mission. The shuttle is also carrying Robonaut2, the first dexterous humanoid robot to be in space. Although its first priority will be to test its operation in microgravity, upgrades could eventually allow it to fulfill its ultimate purpose of becoming an astronaut helper on boring or dangerous tasks. \nThe launch of Discovery, which was supposed to occur at 4:50 p.m., was delayed for three minutes due to a technical problem in the shuttle's command system and a chipped heat shield tile near the crew hatch which needed to be patched. The launch was also repeatedly postponed since November 1 due to various technical problems with the shuttle's systems and a hydrogen leak in the fuel tank along with cracks and bad weather. A small piece of foam broke off during the launch but NASA has reported that it is unlikely to cause problems. \nDiscovery and the crew of STS-133 are scheduled to spend about two weeks in space and aboard the ISS, logging 4.5 million additional miles of flight.\nThe launch comes just hours after an unmanned automated European cargo spacecraft, ATV-2, docked with the orbiting outpost to deliver supplies and equipment to the crew.\nSTS-133 is scheduled to be the final mission of Discovery, with its first being STS-41-D in 1984. Discovery flew 39 flights in its operational history, including the current mission, delivering several payloads to space including the Hubble Space Telescope and visiting two different space stations: Mir and the ISS. STS-133 is the 133rd shuttle mission and the 35th mission to the ISS. Discovery is the oldest surviving shuttle, and has flown more missions than any other shuttle. It was also the first shuttle to fly after the Challenger disaster and was the first shuttle to fly after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Later, Discovery became the first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut. \nAfter the current mission, there will be at most two remaining shuttle flights. Endeavor has one more mission remaining, and if an emergency rescue is needed or more funding is secured, Atlantis will also fly once more before the entire fleet is retired.\n\"The shuttle has provided an amazing capacity for this country to gather data.

This was primarily because of a mis-alignment between the docking systems of the shuttle and station due to gravitational effects. The entire delay took up approximately 40 minutes.\nDuring Discovery's approach to the station earlier on today, the crew of Expedition 26 took pictures of the shuttle's underside from the station's windows in order to assist in analysis of the heat shield of the spacecraft.\nNASA officials are debating whether or not to extend the mission an additional day for a photo shoot of the International Space Station, as it is currently host to six docked spacecraft from the United States, Russia, Europe, and Japan.

The announcement was made at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California. CEO Steve Jobs appeared at the event and introduced the new product, with FaceTime video messaging (with front and rear cameras) as well as a new dual-core Apple A5 processor.\nThe iPad 2 is an all new design and has several improvements over the original iPad. The device runs on an dual-core Apple A5 CPU. According to Jobs, the CPU's new dual-core capability enhances multitasking and doubles the processing speed. Apple additionally introduced a magnetic 'Smart Cover' accessory that snaps to the front screen of the device along with several new apps ported from the Mac OS X operating system and the iPhone. These include iMovie, GarageBand, and Photo Booth. The new iPad introduces front and rear cameras which enable FaceTime. The new tablet is 15% lighter and 33% thinner than the previous version - thinner than an iPhone 4 - and has beveled edges. It will be available in black and white. The device continues to be capable of ten hours of battery life on a single charge.\nThe announcement comes after months of rumors about a successor to the original iPad. Competitors have designed tablets to compete with the iPad such as Motorola's Xoom powered by the Android operating system. One research analyst predicted that iPads would still make up at least 20 million of the more than 24 million tablet computers sold in the United States in 2011. Another analyst credited the Apple's App store for iPad's continued success. The device will become available in the United States on March 11, 2011, available in 16, 32, or 64 gigabytes. iPad 2's 3G models can connect to the wireless networks of AT&T or Verizon Wireless and Wi-Fi. The iPad 2 will start at US$499. In tandem with the announcement, Apple reduced the price of its original iPad to US$399. Shares of Apple inc. rose $2.81, closing at US$352.12 the day of the announcement."}

Snyder had sued Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas for  picketing the funeral of his son, 20-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder who was killed in Iraq in 2006. Snyder said the protest caused him emotional pain and turned his son's funeral into a \"circus.\" \nThe protest was well publicized, a SWAT team was called, and the funeral procession was diverted away from the protesters, who carried signs such as \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers,\" \"God Hates Fags\" and \"America Is Doomed.\" The funeral itself was not disturbed and it was carried out on public land, following local laws. Snyder learned of the content of the slogans only later on television.\nSnyder's son was not a homosexual. The church pickets military soldiers' funerals because they believe that the United States is too tolerant of homosexuality and that the death of U.S. soldiers is divine retribution. They have picketed more than 600 funerals. \nThe Court's decision rested in part on the basis that the subject of the church's speech related to controversial public issues and was not a private attack on Snyder. \"[The church] conducted its picketing peacefully on matters of public concern at a public place adjacent to a public street,\" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in his opinion for the court. \"Such space occupies a special position in terms of First Amendment protection.\" Roberts said that large number of protests conducted by the church against many groups, including Catholics and Jews, is evidence that Phelps and his church were not personally attacking Snyder, but were \"expressing deeply held views on public topics.\" Roberts wrote, \"As a nation we have chosen ... to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.\"\nSamuel Alito, the only Justice to rule against the Church wrote that, \"Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case. In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims.\"\nSnyder was disappointed in the ruling: \"My first thought was eight justices don't have the common sense God gave a goat.

To get to the guns they had to climb up  100-foot cliffs, with covering fire from troops based on the ground for protection. Many of Lomell's men were either shot and killed or fell to their deaths.\nAfter Lomell and others  reached the top of the cliff and fought back the Germans, it became clear that the artillery was not where it was previously believed to be.

A witness on the court said Leonard had ceased to breathe and his heart had stopped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died a little over an hour  later. An autopsy revealed that Leonard had an enlarged heart, causing the cardiac arrest that killed him.\nIt is unclear from media reports whether the school had an automated external defibrillator (AED) available for emergencies, or if the ambulance personnel had employed such equipment.  Also unknown is how much time  elapsed from the moment the player collapsed until the time a defibrillator was employed. Many  schools have acquired defibrillators for such emergencies, according to Michigan High School Athletic Association spokesman John Johnson. He said the devices at schools are not mandated  by law nor by the association's regulations. There is evidence that if, in the first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest, an  AED is used, up to 80% of the victims can survive. Emergency responders usually need at least seven minutes to arrive on the scene.\nNews media describes Leonards death as shocking the community.

The prosecution case was that Ward hit Wass with a brick, and no firearms allegation was made against Ward at trial, but both titles placed a photograph on their websites of Ward with a gun.\nThe papers took the image off their sites within hours, after being ordered to do so. The trial judge, His Honour Judge Michael Murphy QC, who had previously ordered the jury not to consult the Internet, did not halt the prosecution as he felt \"satisfied\" the jury hadn't seen the picture. Ward was convicted.\nLawyers for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers  respective owners of The Daily Mail and the The Sun  had argued in their defence that using the photo posed an \"insubstantial\" risk of prejudice, denying contempt although accepting they made \"a mistake\".\nAttorney General Dominic Grieve had described \"seriously impeded or prejudiced\" proceedings had jurors accessed the photos. Angus McCullough QC represented Grieve, telling the court the \"strict liability\" provisions of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 had been breached.\nHigh Court judges Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Owen Thursday sided with Grieve and McCullough: \"We conclude that the nature of the photograph created a substantial risk of prejudicing any juror who saw that photograph against the defendant Ward.\"\nLord Justice Moses' judgment mentioned the significance of the case in regards to online publications: \"The criminal courts have been troubled by the dangers to the integrity and fairness of a criminal trial, where juries can obtain such easy access to the internet and to other forms of instant communication. Once information is published on the Internet, it is difficult if not impossible completely to remove it... This case demonstrates the need to recognise that instant news requires instant and effective protection for the integrity of a criminal trial.\"\nThe Daily Mail's website covered the ruling in an article in which they also offered an explanation for how they published the photograph. \"[A] journalist had submitted an article about the prosecution along with the photograph by e-mail, including a warning stating the handgun should not be included in any copy of the photograph as it would prejudice the trial,\" it reads. \"But when the story was put up online a freelance journalist, then working for the website, added the photograph without taking any legal advice.\"\nThe penalties for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers will be considered by the judges later."}

The report, released  February 10, accused the archdiocese of a decades long  cover up.\nAccording to the grand jury,  at least 37 priests had continued in their duties around children despite  \"substantial evidence of abuse against them\".   \"We understand that accusations are not proof,\" the report said, \"but we just cannot understand the Archdiocese's apparent absence of any sense of urgency.\" The grand jury  had seen the files of only  20 priests, it said, and in those cases the archdiocese had dismissed credible allegations of abuse  on trivial grounds, such as a victim failing to remember the year in which the priest served or the exact layout of the rectory.\nThe Cardinal's initial statement in reaction to the  report denied there were any active  priests \"who have an admitted or established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor against them.\"  However, days later, he  hired a former sex crimes prosecutor to review the personnel files of all those named in the grand jury's report.\nYesterday's statement placing the 21 priests on leave came more than two weeks after the grand jury released its report. Cardinal Rigali, while apologizing for the behavior of priests abusing minors, said the leaves   were temporary  measures until full  investigations are completed. \nThis mass suspension for sexual abuse is notable in that it is one of the largest in the history  of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. The slow response of the Philadelphia Archdiocese to sexual abuse allegations goes against the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' own 2004 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People which says any priest with creditable allegations should be removed immediately and investigation of the case should follow.\nAlmost a decade ago, allegations of sexual abuse by Philadelphia priests surfaced. A grand jury report issued in 2005 detailed numerous cases of abuse allegations, some decades old,  involving Philadelphia  priests and the  efforts of their superiors to cover up the evidence. The 2011 grand jury found that the panel formed by the archdiocese to handle the complaints in the  2005 report primarily  protected the church rather than the victims.\nDavid Clohessy,  the director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), an advocacy group for survivors and their attorneys, said, \"Many victims and Catholics in Philly, are left seriously wondering how effective the bishops' so-called reforms really are, if dozens and dozens of credibly accused priests in one archdiocese alone are kept in ministry for years.\""}

Additional factors include the declines in flowering plants, the use of harmful chemicals and insecticides, the increase in air pollution and a worldwide trade system that spreads bee pathogens and pests. \nThe world's growing population means more bees are needed to pollinate the crops to feed more people. According to the U.N. report, of the 100 crop species that supply 90 percent of the world's food, bees pollinate more than 70 percent.

Jack Mogale was convicted before Johannesburg High Court on Wednesday of being what police had dubbed the West End Serial Killer. He was today sentenced to twenty concurrent life terms.\nMogale's crimes lasted a year from March 2008 to March 2009, coming to an end when police were passed his car's number plate information following a teen's disappearance. He was arrested shortly after the killing of a prostitute he had hired; he was found to have a phone stolen from another victim when he was detained.\nWhilst the killer was still at-large police named him after the West-End factory, a building materials factory in Waterworks, Westonaria around which most of the attacks were centred. Other victims were attacked in Lenasia.\nJudge Frans Kgomo also chose to convict Mogale, who is in his forties, of three aggravated robberies, sexual assault, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, theft or fraud and escaping lawful custody. He cleared the defendant, who took victims to open areas before comitting sexual murders, of nine other charges.\n41 witnesses testified for the prosecution, including the only two women to survive. Both told the court he had introduced himself as a Zionist Christian preacher and prophet. He wore a Christian Zion badge and sangoma beads, which both victims identified; identity parades were also submitted as evidence. The accused's distinctive facial scar was recognised by the survivors.\nThe first described his help for a uterine ailment; she said he claimed he needed to have sex with her to exorcise a spirit from her and placed herbs in her vagina, but Mogale countered that they had consensual intercourse as part of an affair. The second said he took her to a veld and attacked her after giving her a lift, knocking her unconscious. Upon awakening the following day she said she had maggot-infested wounds and a dislocated jaw. Her genitals and neck were wounded; her front teeth were missing.\nMost of the bodies were badly decomposed when they were found. They had mostly been killed by blunt force to the skull, either with a weapon or hitting their heads against the ground, although some were strangled. Two women were sodomized. DNA and mobile phone records linked him to the crimes. He originally confessed to police.\n\"I want you to help me,\" he told officers after his arrest. \"When I am with a woman I lose control and do not know what to do. I kill all of them when they do not give me what I want.\"\nMogale's defence centred on accusations the witnesses - amongst them his partner, Charlotte Manaka - and police were trying to frame him. He said police took a condom used by he and Manaka to obtain forensic evidence to plant. Manaka directly contradicted this in her testimony, saying they did not use condoms, as well as saying Mogale regularly wore the beads and badge identified by victims. The couple have four children.\nJudge Kgomo noted that \"[t]his defence is very suspicious, especially because the DNA kit was compiled long before the accused was even identified as a suspect and long before he was arrested,\" and that the state witnesses were important to the case. \"The accused was not a very good witness... with his contradictions and new versions... at times he wanted to shift blame onto his defence counsel.\" The judge felt \"he was not telling the whole truth\" and criticised his failure to produce witnesses to back up his claims.\nProfessor Gerard Labuschagne, who does investigative psychology for the police, was an important witness. He told the court similarities between the various attacks meant they were \"undoubtedly by the same offender.\" Some of the bodies remain unidentified.\n\"On the day he was arrested, the accused displayed hatred for women,\" said judge Kgomo. \"He behaved like a psychopath, even showing his manhood to the female police officer. When he met the same policewoman at the station he said, when I come out of here you will be the first person I rape and kill.\" In summary, Kgomo said, \"[t]he state has proved beyond reasonable doubt the accuseds guilt.\"\n\"I didn't do anything,\" protested Mogale shortly before judgement was handed down. \"You know how life is, this is a challenge, I didnt do any of those things. I dont even know those women.\" He has been convicted of rape twice previously.\nAt sentencing today, Judge Kgomo called Mogale an \"evil and perverted murderer and rapist who pose[s] extreme danger to women in society.\" As well as sixteen life terms for the murders, four extra life terms were handed down for raping some women twice. Each of the three aggravated robberies attracted a fifteen-year sentence, each kidnap produced five years, three years for the theft and fraud charge, three for sexual assault, three for escaping custody and five for attempted murder. All the sentences will run concurrently.\n\"Sir, there is no way you can be allowed to be out of prison to come into contact with women,\" Kgomo told Mogale. \"I am removing you permanently from society.\" As Mogale was led away he shouted at the victims' families \"[y]ou are also coming, I pray.

{"id": 1863, "ended": true, "text": "0 A.D. is a historical, open source, strategy game, published by Wildfire Games. It focuses on the period between 500BC and 500AD. The game will be released in two parts: the first covering the pre-AD period, and the second running to 500AD. With development well underway, Wikinews interviewed the development team.\nAviv Sharon, a 24-year-old Israeli student responsible for the project's PR, compiled the below Q&A, which the full team approved prior to publication.\n((Baptiste Domps))  Could you introduce the development team of 0 A.D.?\n((Aviv Sharon)) We are Wildfire Games, a group of approximately 15-20 people from around the world developing 0 A.D., a free, open-source game of ancient warfare. Cumulatively, about 100 different people have contributed to 0 A.D. over time. Our ages have ranged from 15 to >65 and our locations range from North America and Europe to India and New Zealand. The contributions to 0 A.D. are coordinated by a team of department heads led by a lead producer, Erik Johansson (feneur), who is 25 years old from Sweden.\n((BD))  Who are the participants? Salarieds or benevolents?\n((AS)) All contributions to 0 A.D. so far have been on a voluntary basis only. To speed up development, however, we have decided to raise enough money to support 160 hours of paid development of the 0 A.D. codebase. We have tentatively selected the team member who will receive this compensation, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh), but decided to hold off for a few months until we start using these funds to wait until he has more time to dedicate to 0 A.D. development. Otherwise, 0 A.D. development will continue to be voluntary, and all funds donated to 0 A.D. will be used for team expenses only, such as website hosting costs.\n((BD))  Why did you want to make games?\n((AS)) There are several different reasons. Originally, 0 A.D. was born out of a desire to innovate within the RTS genre. We felt, and still feel, that this genre has a lot of potential for innovation and we wish to explore that with some different rules. 0 A.D. started out as a total conversion mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, until team members at that time ran into the limitations of changing a closed-source game. Hence, as a wish to break free from the limitations of other games' engines, the standalone version of 0 A.D. was conceived and its development continues to this day.\nSome other reasons include a deep appreciation of ancient history; the wish to improve our skills and be recognized for our talents; and a determination to prove that a group of volunteers collaborating over the internet can make a game that rivals the commercial, proprietary AAA titles.\n((BD))  Why did you choose a free license?\n((AS)) People are spending more money, time and attention on playing computer games than ever before, and games are constantly evolving into a more nuanced medium of expression and a greater part of our culture. Just observe how much people play on Facebook and their mobile devices. We think this culture should allow gamers to learn how their games work, change them, share them and redistribute their works. This freedom to tinker is what Free, Open-Source Software (FOSS) is all about and so we hope a lot of people tinker with 0 A.D.\n((BD))  How do you coordinate? What technical and financial resources has 0 A.D.?\n((AS)) We mostly coordinate over a forum system we have, as well as a Trac system for task management and technical documentation. We also conduct discussions over IRC (#0ad and #0ad-dev on QuakeNet), that get more concentrated on the weekend, and Saturday afternoon in particular, when we have our weekly meeting.\n((BD))  Which type of participants do you need? 'Amateurs' can they participate?\n((AS)) Amateurs can definitely help with tasks like documentation and spreading the word about 0 A.D. For other tasks, we do require some prior knowledge in fields such as software development, 3d animation etc. \nOur main personnel needs are in three fields: Programmers, artists and sound people. We have many applicants for sound contributors but need a manager to oversee them. For programming we need capable gameplay, AI, sound and graphics programmers, proficient in C++ and/or JavaScript. Finally, in the art department, we could use some more texture artists, 3D artists, animators, and illustrators to draw 2d icons for the game's user interface.\n((BD))  It's been 10 years since 0 A.D. is developing, what obstacles have arisen and how have you resolved?\n((AS)) The biggest obstacle we have run into is underestimating the scale and complexity of an RTS game. When embarking upon this journey in 2001, nobody thought that completing this endeavor would take this long. Evidently, making an RTS game requires a great deal of programming features, art assets and more. And, as we discovered the hard way, the first draft of anything is seldom good enough. For example, one of the most important engine components, named \"Simulation\", was simply planned wrong the first time around. Simulation is in charge of changing the state of each entity in the \"world\" represented in the game, like handling harvesting resources, doing damage to stuff and handling death. Sadly, over time it got implemented in such a haphazard way it devolved into an unstable, unpredictable ball of mud. Debugging became difficult and attracting new programmers from joining the development effort became impossible. Over time, fewer and fewer developers stayed on with 0 A.D. and it seemed as if the project was in grave danger of ending, the way many initiatives on the internet spontaneously do.\nThankfully, one of our programmers, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh) from the UK, fixed this situation almost singlehandedly over the course of a few months in 2009-2010. Ever since simulation was fixed, it's been smoother sailing and the pace of development picked up considerably. We have recruited several programmers and are constantly adding new features, most recently a prototype opponent AI, which is a big milestone for us.\n((BD))  What are you proudest of about your game?\nWe are proud of the way our fans go \"wow\" over screenshots, in-game videos and their direct experiences with the game. We get comments like, \"It's like Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and Rise of Nations had a baby and it came out free!\" and \"This can't be open source. It rocks too much!\". We're proud we've built a community of enthusiasts on our forums, Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere, and continuously generated some buzz around 0 A.D. We hope to justify this hype and lead the project to completion.\n((BD))  What is the schedule for 2011?\n((AS)) One big upcoming feature is random map scripting, which allows for much more variety in gameplay without having to manually draw new maps all the time. Our prototype opponent AI is set to get even smarter at all aspects of gameplay, and, with time, will be able to execute any of a variety of strategies to win the game. However, generally speaking, we don't make long-term plans because they never seem to work out. So far, since August 2010 we have released an alpha version every 70 days on average, and we intend to keep releasing more alpha versions until the game is feature-complete. Then we will enter a beta phase, playtest and fix bugs until a point when we decide the game is done, hopefully sometime in 2012."}

Autism commonly  affects the ability to interact socially and is associated with repetitive behavior. The finding was reported in the March 20 online edition of Nature.\nUsing mice, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Duke University mutated one of the genes associated with autism, known as shank3, a gene that controls the production of the shank3 protein present in the brain. Mice that were given this mutation exhibited repetitive behavior and avoided social interactions with the mice around them. \nAccording to MIT Professor Guoping Feng: \"Our study demonstrated that Shank3 mutation in mice lead to defects in neuron-neuron communications.\"\nShank3 protein are found in  synapses within the brain. Synapses allow brain cells  (called neurons) to communicate with each other. The mutation in the mouse gene interfered with this  communication, apparently producing the subsequent autism-like traits. Researchers believe their work demonstrates the important role of shank3 in the functioning of brain circuits that determine behavior.\nWhile hundreds of genes have been linked to autism in human patients, only a small percentage have been linked to shank3. Professor  Feng hypothesizes that  disruptions of other genes that act on the production of brain proteins affecting synaptic communication may also be related to autistic behavior. If this disruption is real, Feng claims that treatments could be developed to correct synaptic function for any  defective synaptic protein in an autistic  patient.  \nFeng continued; \"These findings and the mouse model now allow us to figure out the precise neural circuit defects responsible for these abnormal behaviours, which could lead to novel strategies and targets for developing treatment.\"   \nAbout one in 110 children in the U.S., and at least one in 100 in UK, have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, for which there is currently no effective cure."}

Detroit, once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its lowest number of residents since 1910.\nPopulation numbers affect the amount of federal and state funding a city receives. In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000, special measures to raise revenue and  allocating it a larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted. Now that Detroit's population has fallen to 713,777, it is no longer eligible for these financial advantages.\nThe mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing plans to appeal the census results. He says more than 35,000 residents were not counted.\n\"Every person thats counted in the census brings approximately $10,000 to Detroit over the next decade for schools, roads, hospitals, and social service programs,\" Bing explained. \"Additionally, we could lose millions in statutory revenue sharing from the state. We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar. We cant afford to let these results stand.\"\nDetroit was  the fifth largest U.S. city in 1950.

Approximately 23 percent of the citys living quarters are now empty. To reduce the city's size there is a program in progress to demolish 10,000 abandoned or vacant buildings and turn the land into farms or countryside by 2014.\nDetroit's congressional power has been steadily decreasing. It already lost one congressional seat since the 1980s.\nU.S. federal laws forbid drawing congressional district boundaries that dilute minority voting strength. The 2000 redistricting rules for the 2012 elections mandated that Detroit's two  congressional districts must be 60 percent black voters, since four out of five of Detroit's residents are black. To comply, the two remaining congressional districts will have to expand into Detroit's mostly  white suburbs to attain enough minority voters to meet the 60 percent target, reducing the clout of black Detroit.\nAndrew Beveridge, Queens College sociology professor, attributed Detroit's population decline to the loss of its industrial base.

The trams will be used to supply additional capacity on the network between Elmers End, central Croydon and Therapia Lane  one of the most congested parts of the route.\nTfL, who purchased the Tramlink network from Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. in 2008, announced the plans late January, after submitting the tender to the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on January 29. According to the notice, the additional trams will operate approximately 75,000km per year, will be needed for \"at least 10, but not more than 20 years\" and can be either new build or existing vehicles that can be modified  at a reasonable cost  to run on the Tramlink infrastructure.\nThe tram fleet is currently made up of 24 Bombardier CR4000 trams, which were constructed for the opening of the 28km network  between 1998 and 2000. 22 of these trams are currently needed to operate the three tram routes each day, and the new service is expected to require at least an additional five trams daily, bringing about the need for a boost to the fleet levels.\nThe shortlist to supply the trams consists of City of Edinburgh/CAF, Stadler (Stadler Pankow GmBH) and Pesa (Pojazdy Szynowe PESA Bydgoszcz S.A.Holding, and the the three consortia will now be invited to submit proposals to supply the additional trams. The Invitation to Tender will run for four weeks.\nIt is not currently known whether the bids made by Stadler and Pesa will be for new-build or second-hand vehicles, however the bid from Edinburgh/CAF is to use a number of the currently-dormant trams that were constructed for that city's own tram network. The system has had several set backs since construction began, with the network now set to open in stages with a number of tram lines (but not the trams to operate them) being cancelled, leading to a large surplus of vehicles that could be hired out in the short term. The trams are amongst some of the longest and heaviest in Europe, though, and will require a large amount of modification to enable them to be able to operate on Croydon's network if the bid is successful.\nShortly after the announcement, whilst inspecting one of the network's current trams at East Croydon tram stop, Boris Johnson said: \"I have no greater responsibility as Mayor than to ensure people can move around this city with ease, comfort and reliability.\n\"Trams in Croydon have proved a major success and this is reflected in journey numbers which have soared by 45 per cent since the network opened in 2000.\n\"I look forward to the extra vehicles developing this vital, much-appreciated, and indeed attractive, form of transport further.\"\nFunding for the new trams is expected to largely come from TfL, however the London Borough of Croydon has also confirmed a 3m contribution to the project. This will also include the refurbishment of tram stop surrounds.\nCroydon Council Leader Mike Fisher said: \"This is looking like a great deal for Croydon and shows the benefits of an ambitious local authority and committed Mayor working together, pooling resources and expertise.\n\"There is real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations.\"\nTfL anticipates that, providing a successful bid is made, the new trams would be delivered to the network's depot at Therapia Lane in late 2011, with an entry into service from early 2012."}

The plans, which were originally to see tram-train operation on a trial basis over the Penistone line during 2010, have been on the cards since 2008, but were shelved during 2009 to allow alternative proposals to be drawn up. The current plans will now see the vehicles operating along a currently-freight-only line between Rotherham and Meadowhall, before linking up with the existing South Yorkshire Supertram network there and continuing onto the streets of Sheffield.\nThe plans to use tram-trains  which are already in widespread use throughout continental Europe, but not at all within the UK  have come about as an alternative to an original proposal to extend the Supertram network to Rotherham, which would be a much larger expense for the same or even fewer benefits.\nWhilst the journey between Sheffield and Rotherham is already covered by mainline trains, project officials believe that the new service  running via Meadowhall South and Rotherham Central and terminating at Parkgate, with a twenty-minute headway throughout  will attract extra custom to the intermediate points between the two conurbations, as well as making travel easier for people who find it hard to walk to and from Sheffield's railway station; the tram-trains will serve the heart of the city-centre.\nNow that the funding for further feasibility work has been approved, Network Rail, Northern Rail and the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) can continue to look at the business and project case for the trial, which will look at a range of issues, including economic and environmental benefits of the tram-trains, and ensuring that the vehicles will be safe to run on both the Supertram network and heavy rail tracks.\nTransport Minister Norman Baker announced the sum, and stressed the Governments commitment to the scheme: There is no doubt about finance being available to deliver the scheme. The Government is committed to a trial of tram-trains in the UK and the route between Sheffield and Rotherham is the best place to develop it. This is a unique scheme.\n\"Tram-trains offer passengers travelling from rural and suburban areas into city centres a viable, environmentally sound alternative to short and medium car commuting that can cut congestion and reduce overcrowding at railway stations.\nThese sorts of rail fleets are already in use on the continent, but this is a first for the UK. The funding we are providing for this exciting project represents a real chance for us to test whether they can be adapted successfully for South Yorkshire and the rest of the UK.\"\nDavid Brown, director of SYPTE, added: We have done an awful lot of work on the plans so far and further efforts will look at ensuring the vehicles are compatible with both types of network, which are the same gauge.\nIf further investigations are successful, the system could be up and running by 2014."}

On the steps leading up to the National Gallery lay placards, dropped by demonstrators the night before. Hours earlier the square was an arena for running battles between the anarchist protesters and riot police.\nFirst, they targetted Oxford Street, arguably the most famous shopping row in the city. The protesters, many dressed in black, hurled smoke bombs and paint at Topshop, which they claimed has systematically abused the tax system. In Piccadilly, they ransacked The Ritz, a hotel popularly known for upmarket opulence. As darkness fell over the capital, many went home. But in Trafalgar Square, protesters lit campfires and danced to music, smoking and eating into the night.\nBut then the police moved in. Clad in riot gear, the situation began to escalate and both they and the demonstrators began to panic. They raised their batons and shouted at the crowd, while the protesters grabbed metal barriers and hurled them over police lines, using them as battering rams. Some protesters yelled in defence, \"Don't hit us!\", while the more determined shouted, \"Shame on you! Your job's next!\" The riot officers pushed protesters into the centre of the square, towards Nelson's Column. The police started forward at least twice swinging their batons in the air, as protesters retaliated by throwing glass bottles and coins towards the police lines.

The lines will add a further 17.4km to the network.\nAfter making the announcement on Thursday, Transport Minister Norman Baker said: Line One of the Nottingham tram has proved to be a great success in encouraging people on to public transport. These proposed extensions provide the opportunity to continue this success, and give people in the south of Nottingham quicker, more convenient access to the city centre, as well as helping to regenerate sections of the city.\n\"Following the spending review last year, we challenged Nottingham City Council to look again at the cost of the Nottingham light rail extension, to be funded through the private finance initiative, to ensure we get maximum value for every pound we spend.\n\"The Department has been working closely with the local authority involved to ensure this project is affordable.

The census results, publicised today, show the population of India now stands at 1.21 billion. C. Chandramauli, the commissioner of the census, said India's population represents \"over 17 percent of the world population, [while] India is 2.4 percent of the worlds surface area.\" \nAccording to BBC News Online, the current population of the country is in excess of the populations of Pakistan, Indonesia,  Bangladesh, Brazil and the United States put together. While India's population has increased by more than 17 percent since the 2001 census, this growth rate is the lowest since India achieved independence in 1947. Between 1991 and 2011, the population growth rate has steadily decreased. Approximately 25 percent of Indians over the age of seven were found to be illiterate in the 2011 census, a decrease of 10 percent from the census held ten years ago. The increase in literate females is greater than that of males, the new census reports. \nThe findings have suggested a preference of male over female children. For every one thousand boys below the age of seven, there were 914 girls, a decrease from the 2001 census, which reported 927 female for every one thousand male children. Chandramauli called this discovery \"a matter of grave concern. This is the lowest ever in the demographic history of the country,\" he said, and noted \"[t]he last census in 2001 had warned us about this, the tendency has worsened.\" This pattern continues although the Indian government has prohibited hospitals from disclosing the gender of an unborn child.\nAccording to The Washington Post, parents in much of India abort female fetuses and murder young female children for financial reasons. Incidents like this occur more frequently in the better educated and the richer Indian states, including Punjab and Gujarat. G.K. Pillai, the home secretary, has claimed that \"[w]hatever policy measures we have been following in the last 40 years will need a complete review now. They have not been effective\".\nThere are now 940 female adults for every one thousand men, in contrast to 2001, when there were 933 women per thousand males. However, in the capital, Delhi, only 866 females were counted for every one thousand males.\nThroughout the states of India, the population growth rate varies significantly. This results in an inequality in the allocation of funds and is a problem, experts say.  According to Management Institute of Population and Development consultant Devendra Kothari: \"Our federal government sends funds to the states according to their population. This means that the states that have worked harder to reduce their population growth get less money from New Delhi\". Kothari continued: \"The states with lesser population send fewer members to the Indian parliament. Their financial and political clout will go down.\"\nOver the course of the approaching year, concluding census figures will be publicised, according to officials."}

The change means that the entire network will be able to be integrated throughout, rather than having two operators effectively running two separate systems.\nNottingham City Council have selected Tramlink Nottingham as their preferred bidder to construct and operate the NET Phase Two lines to Chilwell and Clifton, and will now enter talks with the consortium, made up of Alstom, Keolis, Trent Barton, VINCI Construction UK, OFI Infravia and Meridiam Infrastructure, to finalise the exact details of the contract. It is expected that the concessionary contract will be awarded during the coming summer, with construction starting before the end of the year. The contract will run for 23 years.\nTramlink Nottingham chairman Roger Harrison said: \"Building on Arrow's successful legacy, we are excited to be taking forward the next chapter in Nottingham's tram story.\n\"Our focus now will be on working with Nottingham City Council to ensure NET Phase Two can be introduced at the earliest opportunity.\"\nThe reshuffle of operating consortium means that Nottingham City Transport (NCT)  the main provider of bus services within Nottingham  will have no part to play in the extended network, despite the numerous awards and high satisfaction levels NET has had since its opening; it is the only one of Britain's five light rail networks to be an instant success.\n\"We're obviously very disappointed not to be part of the selected preferred consortium. Nottingham's tram has won numerous awards and after seven years passengers continue to praise its operation. We would have relished the opportunity to have been part of this continuing success,\" said NCT's Managing Director Mark Fowles.\nBut the council stresses that they are still committed to the future of the company.\n\"This decision in no way reflects the excellent job Arrow Light Rail Limited has done operating the tram since its launch. Annual customer satisfaction figures remain very high and this is testament to this operation,\" added Jane Todd. \"The decision to appoint a new consortium to build and operate the extended tram network was made on the basis of selecting the best proposal to meet the council's objectives for the future of the tram system. The overall offer from the Tramlink Nottingham consortium was stronger. Although disappointing for NCT it is nonetheless good news for the integration of public transport services that the city's other major bus operator, Trent Barton, is part of the preferred bidder. I am certain NCT will continue to provide award winning bus services for the people of Nottingham.\"\nStaff currently employed by Arrow Light Rail are expected to be transferred over to Tramlink Nottingham around August, when further details of the contract will become clear. Other changes that are proposed for the network include 'smart card' ticketing  similar to the highly successful Oyster scheme that is in use across Transport for London's service  and the phasing out of tram conductors in favour of on-platform ticketing machines. Current conductors will be offered new roles within the company, though talks are still on-going about how to combat any potential fare-dodgers.\nFurthermore, an additional 22 tram vehicles will be built by consortium member Alstom for the extended network, though these will be of a different design to the 15 existing vehicles, which were built by Bombardier to their Incentro design for the system's opening. The new trams will be part of Alstom's Citadis family, and will bring the total tram fleet to 37. This will also allow for service frequencies to be increased and for overcrowding to be eased at peak times.\nTicketing arrangements for the network will also change when the new consortium takes over. Currently, combined tickets, cards and passes can be used for the tram and NCT buses, but these are due to be phased out and replaced with the new smart cards in time for the opening of the extensions. Prior to that, passengers will be able to use combined tickets, cards and passes for the tram and Trent Barton buses, in a similar arrangement to that which is already offered for NCT.\nPat Armstrong, director for NET, said: \"The move is very much towards more sophisticated smart ticketing, like the Oyster card in London. You use the same card but the money goes back to the company you are travelling with.\"\nThe extended network, new trams and numerous other changes should be fully operational by the end of 2014, but NET users and tramway enthusiasts had mixed views on the matter:\n\"I think it's a bad idea to phase out the conductors,\" said Andrew Blood, assistant editor of the Tramways Monthly e-magazine, \"Not only do they help with revenue protection, but they are also responsible for the high passenger satisfaction levels on the system. In short, they keep tram users feeling safe.\"\nGreg Smith, from Hucknall, was pleased that service levels were going to increase: \"The fact that the trams will be running more frequently is a massive bonus in my eyes. The service we get at [the Hucknall] end of the line is great already, but if [the trams] are running more frequently it's just another advantage of the system over the bus.\" But he was also wary of on-platform ticketing being brought into place: \"I'm not sure that losing the conductors in favour of ticket machines is the way to go, though.\""}

Until the final design and modelling have been settled, anyone who uses these figures to scare families about prices is engaging in a dishonest, misleading scare campaign.\"\nOpposition Leader Tony Abbott said the figures demonstrated the toll a carbon tax would have on Australian families. This just demonstrates that the Government has known all along that its carbon tax won't clean up the environment but it will clean out your wallet,\" he said. That's right and this is $863 a year in extra burden that the Australian people shouldn't have to pay. This is an $863 a year hit on families' cost of living. Families are doing it tough as things stand. They don't need a bad situation made much, much worse by Julia Gillard's carbon tax.\"\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has also officially opposed the adoption of a carbon tax.

Included are candy stores, bakeries, and ice-cream parlors.\nThe FDA's proposed guidelines specify that chains post the calorie counts of foods and drinks on menus and menu boards or next to the food item, such as at a salad bar. The menu is to prominently exhibit the calorie content of each item in a way customers can see easily, giving them the same information packaged foods prepared at home currently provide. The information must be displayed in \"clear and conspicuous\" print and colors.\nMany cities and states have passed laws requiring calorie labeling on menus, beginning with New York City in 2008. California implemented a similar law in January, although many counties are waiting for the release of the federal guidelines before they begin enforcement.

Television station TV Globo reported that Olivera entered the Tasso da Silveira municipal school, telling officials that he was attending to make a speech to students. He was reportedly carrying at least two revolvers and a significant amount of ammunition.\nWitnesses state that he began to fire at pupils' heads, killing ten girls and one boy. Rio state health secretary, Sergio Cortes, stated that those injured in the attack were taken to local hospitals. At least four were said to be in a \"grave\" condition.\nRio's Police chief, Martha Rocha, said in a press conference that the gunman had no previous criminal history. She stated that he was carrying 2 firearms, although she did not specify what type. During the attack he fired off at least 30 rounds of ammunition. There were approximately 400 people in the school when the attack began, and shortly after the shooting started, two small boys outside the school, one with a gunshot wound, ran almost two city blocks until they found police and alerted them to the incident.\nThe two officers who were made aware ran to the school, and quickly managed to locate the gunman, leading to a shooting match. One officer, Marcio Alves, stated that \"He saw me and aimed a gun at me, I shot him in the legs, he fell down the stairs and then shot himself in the head.\"\nPolice report that Olivera was carrying a \"long and rambling\" letter, confirming his intentions to commit suicide.  \nIn a statement by the Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, he made it clear that life at the school had become a \"hellish nightmare.\" Authorities closed the school temporarily while they investigate, but Mayor Paes confirmed that the school will reopen.\nThe fate of all the children in the school is not yet known. One eleven year old pupil from the school, Wanderson Barbosa, was interviewed by Associated Press as he sat on the steps of his house. He was in his classroom when the attack started, and he and others in his class thought that other students were fighting, until his teacher told them to get to the floor, because it was gunfire. \n\"I'm so worried,\" Barbosa said to reporters, \"We don't have news of everyone yet.\"\nMeanwhile, Rio's Governor, Sergio Cabral, called the attacker a \"psychopath\", whilst indicating that he does not believe anyone else was involved in the attack, but that investigations into the incident will continue."}

{"id": 1936, "ended": true, "text": "\nLate last month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed objections to the United States Government's 'secret' attempts to obtain Twitter account information relating to WikiLeaks. The ACLU and EFF cite First and Fourth amendment issues as overriding reasons to overturn government attempts to keep their investigation secret; and, that with Birgitta Jonsdottir being an Icelandic Parliamentarian, the issue has serious international implications.\nThe case, titled \"In the Matter of the 2703(d) Order Relating to Twitter Accounts: Wikileaks, Rop_G, IOERROR; and BirgittaJ\", has been in the EFF's sights since late last year when they became aware of the US government's attempts to investigate WikiLeaks-related communications using the popular microblogging service.\nThe key objective of this US government investigation is to obtain data for the prosecution of Bradley Manning, alleged to have supplied classified data to WikiLeaks. In addition to Manning's Twitter account, and that of WikiLeaks (@wikileaks), the following three accounts are subject to the order: @ioerror, @birgittaj, and @rop_g. These, respectively, belong to Jacob Apelbaum, Birgitta Jonsdottir, and Rop Gonggrijp.\nBirgitta is not the only non-US citizen with their Twitter account targeted by the US Government; Gonggrijp, a Dutch 'ex-hacker'-turned-security-expert, was one of the founders of XS4ALL  the first Internet Service Provider in the Netherlands available to the public. He has worked on a mobile phone that can encrypt conversations, and proven that electronic voting systems can readily be hacked.\nIn early March, a Virginia magistrate judge ruled that the government could have the sought records, and neither the targeted users, or the public, could see documents submitted to justify data being passed to the government. The data sought is as follows:\nThe order demands disclosure of absolutely all such data from November 1, 2009 for the targeted accounts.\nThe ACLU and EFF are not only challenging this, but demanding that all submissions made by the US government to justify the Twitter disclosure are made public, plus details of any other such cases which have been processed in secret.\nBradley Manning, at the time a specialist from Maryland enlisted with the United States Army's 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, was arrested in June last year in connection with the leaking of classified combat video to WikiLeaks.\nThe leaked video footage, taken from a US helicopter gunship, showed the deaths of Reuters staff Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen during a U.S. assault in Baghdad, Iraq. The wire agency unsuccessfully attempted to get the footage released via a Freedom of Information Act request in 2007.\nWhen WikiLeaks released the video footage it directly contradicted the official line taken by the U.S. Army asserting that the deaths of the two Reuters staff were \"collateral damage\" in an attack on Iraqi insurgents. The radio chatter associated with the AH-64 Apache video indicated the helicopter crews had mistakenly identified the journalists' equipment as weaponry.\nThe US government also claims Manning is linked to CableGate; the passing of around a quarter of a million classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. Manning has been in detention since July last year; in December allegations of torture were made to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the conditions under which he was and is being detained.\nReports last month that he must now sleep naked and attend role call at the U.S. Marine facility in Quantico in the same state, raised further concern over his detention conditions. Philip J. Crowley, at-the-time a State Department spokesman, remarked on this whilst speaking at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; describing the current treatment of Manning as \"ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid\", Crowley was, as a consequence, put in the position of having to tender his resignation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nDespite his native Australia finding, in December last year, that Assange's WikiLeaks had not committed any criminal offences in their jurisdiction, the U.S. government has continued to make ongoing operations very difficult for the whistleblower website.\nThe result of the Australian Federal Police investigation left the country's Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, having to retract a statement that WikiLeaks had acted \"illegally\"; instead, she characterised the site's actions as \"grossly irresponsible\".\nEven with Australia finding no illegal activity on the part of WikiLeaks, and with founder Julian Assange facing extradition to Sweden, U.S. pressure sought to hobble WikiLeaks financially.\nBased on a State Department letter, online payments site PayPal suspended WikiLeaks account in December. Their action was swiftly followed by Visa Europe and Mastercard ceasing to handle payments for WikiLeaks.\nThe online processing company, Datacell, threatened the two credit card giants with legal action over this. However, avenues of funding for the site were further curtailed when both Amazon.com and Swiss bank PostFinance joined the financial boycott of WikiLeaks.\nAssange continues, to this day, to argue that his extradition to Sweden for questioning on alleged sexual offences is being orchestrated by the U.S. in an effort to discredit him, and thus WikiLeaks.\nWikinews consulted an IT and cryptography expert from the Belgian university which developed the current Advanced Encryption Standard; explaining modern communications, he stated: \"Cryptography has developed to such a level that intercepting communications is no longer cost effective. That is, if any user uses the correct default settings, and makes sure that he/she is really connecting to Twitter it is highly unlikely that even the NSA can break the cryptography for a protocol such as SSL/TLS (used for https).\"\nQualifying this, he commented that \"the vulnerable parts of the communication are the end points.\" To make his point, he cited the following quote from Gene Spafford: \"Using encryption on the Internet is the equivalent of arranging an armored car to deliver credit card information from someone living in a cardboard box to someone living on a park bench.\"\nContinuing, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL) expert explained:\nWikinews also consulted French IT security researcher Stevens Le Blond on the issues surrounding the case, and the state-of-the-art in monitoring, and analysing, communications online. Le Blond, currently presenting a research paper on attacks on Tor to USENIX audiences in North America, responded via email:\nHaving been alerted to the ongoing case through a joint press release by the ACLU and EFF, Wikinews sought clarification on the primary issues which the two non-profits saw as particularly important in challenging the U.S. Government over the 'secret' court orders. Rebecca Jeschke, Media Relations Director for the EFF, explained in more detail the points crucial to them, responding to a few questions from Wikinews on the case:\nFinally, Wikinews approached the Icelandic politician, and WikiLeaks supporter, who has made this specific case a landmark in how the U.S. Government handles dealings with  supposedly  friendly governments and their elected representatives. A number of questions were posed, seeking the Icelandic Parliamentarian's views:\nThe U.S. Government continues to have issues internationally as a result of material passed to WikiLeaks, and subsequently published.\nWithin the past week, Ecuador has effectively declared the U.S. ambassador Heather Hodges persona-non-grata over corruption allegations brought to light in leaked cables. Asking the veteran diplomat to leave \"as soon as possible\", the country may become the third in South America with no ambassadorial presence. Both Venezuela and Bolivia have no resident U.S. ambassador due to the two left-wing administrations believing the ejected diplomats were working with the opposition.\nThe U.S. State Department has cautioned Ecuador that a failure to speedily normalise diplomatic relations may jeapordise ongoing trade talks.\nThe United Kingdom is expected to press the Obama administration over the continuing detention of 23-year-old Manning, who also holds UK citizenship. British lawmakers are to discuss his ongoing detention conditions before again approaching the U.S. with their concerns that his solitary confinement, and treatment therein, is not acceptable.\nThe 22 charges brought against Manning are currently on hold whilst his fitness to stand trial is assessed."}

After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage.\nNathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, France's Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea, confirmed to reporters: \"Bodies were found. They will be recovered and identified.\"\n\"We werent prepared for that. We are now confronted with another trauma,\" Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et Solidarit AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said. Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed. \"For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed.\"\nThe remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres (1,968 feet by 656 feet) area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air. Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.\nAccording to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation. The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros ($7.1 million) according to estimates, will be financed by the French government. Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals. The operation should take between three weeks to a month.\nOn raising the remains of the plane Troadec said: \"We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again.\" Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, \"We want to know what happened in that plane.\" An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying \"There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering.\"\nSoulas of Entraide et Solidarit AF447 disagreed. \"There's a very traumatic side to this and it causes problems of identification. We don't know what state they are in.\" He added, \"And it risks causing a dispute between families who want to leave the bodies at the bottom of the Atlantic and those who want them brought to the surface.\"\nHowever, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two flight recorders, the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) have yet to be found at the crash site.\nAlain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, \"It's still a jigsaw puzzle. We do not know where the recorders might be.\"\nThere are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable. Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had \"great confidence\" in their robustness.\nWithout the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash. The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash.\nThe plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down."}

On April 12, 1981, Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on STS-1, the first space shuttle mission.\nNASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar, known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1, for Space Shuttle Atlantis, which is being prepped for its final mission which will be STS-135, which will be the last Space Shuttle mission.\nAt the ceremony, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the Space Shuttle program. The prototype orbiter, Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City.\nSpace Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center. Discovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month, its 39th mission. Discovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiter.\nSpace Shuttle Endeavour, which will launch on STS-134 at the end of the month on April 29, will be sent to the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California following its retirement. Finally, Atlantis will go on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex following the orbiter's last flight which launches June 28.\nColumbia was lost tragically back on February 1, 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboard. Space Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28, 1986 killing all six aboard.\n\"We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures,\" said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees. \"This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind. In the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program. These facilities we've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors.\"\nOver twenty locations looked to obtain one of the orbiters because of potential tourism booms from them.\nNot all were pleased with the final choice of locations. U.S. Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas as a location. Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASAs decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters. Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet.\"\nCornyn's statement added, There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiterseven Administrator Bolden stated as much. Todays announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administrations misguided decision. However, the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck.\nThe Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle, going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter. In a statement, Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said, The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit. While the Museum of Flight was in the top running, Im disappointed that NASA did not choose them.\nHowever, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including [former Museum of Flight CEO] Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home. The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get. Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum. It will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science, technology, engineering and math.\"\nOther items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois, the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum of McMinnville, Oregon, and Texas A&M's Aerospace Engineering Department.

The American public trusts us to run a safe system,\" he added, vowing to do anything necessary to resolve the issue. His comments came as the FAA announced new plans to tackle fatigue in controllers, saying they were taking immediate steps to employ additional staff at 27 airports across the U.S. The FAA said it would \"not tolerate\" controllers falling asleep on duty. \"This type of unprofessional behavior does not meet our high safety standards,\" a spokesperson said.\nKrakowski's resignation will likely be seen as an indication that the crisis in control towers across the U.S. is growing. Randy Babbitt, the administrator of the FAA, confirmed Krakowski had submitted his resignation, which had accepted. \"Over the last few weeks we have seen examples of unprofessional conduct on the part of a few individuals that have rightly caused the traveling public to question our ability to ensure their safety,\" he said. \"This conduct must stop immediately.

The FAA said the flight crew made contact with a controller at a different facility and made a safe landing. \"The controller, who was out of communication for approximately 16 minutes, has been suspended while the FAA investigates,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe incident is the latest in a string of controllers falling asleep on duty. Last month two passenger jets landed safely in Washington D.C. without clearance to do so because they were unable to make contact with any controllers in the tower at the airport. It emerged the only controller in the tower had fallen asleep after working four nights in a row. In February, a controller at McGhee Tyson Airport in Tennessee allegedly deliberately went to sleep while on duty. The controllers involved in both incidents have been suspended by the FAA.

Charles Perrow, a professor at Yale University, said the oil industry \"is ill prepared at the least\" to deal with another oil spill. \"I have seen no evidence that they have marshaled containment efforts that are sufficient to deal with another major spill,\" he said. \nWhile the government has implemented new regulations, technical systems for stopping oil flowing from a leaking well, and increased oversight from oil officials, Perrow said deep water drilling had become no less dangerous. \"I don't think they have found ways to change the corporate culture sufficiently to prevent future accidents,\" he said. \"There are so many opportunities for things to go wrong that major spills are unavoidable.\" \nLast year, Doug Inkley, a scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said the culture of an \"addiction to oil\" was ultimately responsible for the catastrophe. \"How long must we wait for lawmakers to act to prevent future disasters? How many more lives, livelihoods and animals must be claimed by our addiction to oil?\" Greenpeace also slammed BP, who ran Deepwater Horizon, for how they allowed the disaster to happen. \"The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now,\" the organization said.\nHowever, under pressure from industry executives the administration of president Barack Obama has resumed issuing drilling permits. It is understood regulators are still allowing oil companies to obtain drilling permits before reviewing new spill response plans. \"I'm not an oddsmaker, but I would say in the next five years we should have at least one major blowout,\" Perrow said. \"Even if everybody tries very hard, there is going to be an accident caused by cost-cutting and pressure on workers. These are moneymaking machines and they make money by pushing things to the limit.\"\nBP has insisted it has changed safety procedures. The oil giant came under heavy criticism for how it handled the crisis, and other major oil companies insisted Deepwater Horizon was a result of a culture exclusive to BP. Michael Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), the U.S. government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling, said the view was \"as disappointing as it is shortsighted,\" and the issue of deep water safety was \"a broad problem.\"\nThe warnings came as it emerged BP had attempted to take control of an independent study into the environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Internal emails expose how BP executives attempted to influence the study, which was funded by a US$500m grant from the oil company. The study may be part of the final verdict as to what penalties, fines and criminal charges are brought against the company. Greenpeace, who uncovered the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request, attacked the reportedly unsuccessful attempts to influence the supposedly independent study as \"outrageous\".\nProtesters rallied outside BP's annual conference in London this week, where shareholders met for the first time since the disaster off the Gulf coast. Executives faced questions over their competence and large salaries from angry shareholders, many of whom disapproved of the appointment of Carl-Henric Svanberg as chairman and Sir Bill Castell as the head of BP's safety board. \nSome demonstrators purchased shares in BP in an attempt to get inside the meeting; one woman, a fisherwoman who lives on the Gulf Coast was arrested after pouring a black substance down herself at the entrance to the conference centre and refusing to move. \"I have travelled all the way over from the Gulf Coast and I just wanted to talk those responsible for destroying my community,\" she said as she was led away by police. \"My community is dead.

Only rice has shown a slight decrease in price. \nThe steep rise in the cost of food is being driven by a combination of factors, including bad weather in food exporting areas such as Russia, Ukraine, North America and China,  rising energy costs that increase the cost of producing and transporting food, and the incentives for  farmers in many countries to produce crops for biofuels  instead of for food. \n\"The linkage between food and fuel is much tighter than it was ten years ago,\" said Zoellick.\nAdditionally,  the change in diet of the growing middle class  in developing countries means they  consume more meat and pork products which take increased grain to produce and drives up the price of feed stocks.\nNational food investment and export policies of some wealthier countries are affecting poorer nations. For example, China is acquiring large amounts of land in Africa to grow food for the needs of the Chinese; Saudi Arabia has given up wheat production to invest overseas for food, and a drought in Russia has led it to implement an export ban on wheat.\nZoellick spoke in Washington at the opening of the  meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He hopes to discuss food policies with officials of the G-20 countries to develop a \"code of conduct\" on export bans and to encourage these countries to do more to  increase food production and aid developing countries in managing  agricultural problems.\nOn Saturday, the World Bank and the IMF issued \"Global Monitoring Report 2011: Improving the Odds of Achieving the MDGs\" which said the world was still on track  toward reaching a key goal of reducing the number of the world's people living in extreme poverty and hunger by half, to  883 million, by the target date of 2015.  Most of the world's progress is due to fast growth in India and China, while African countries are behind.  "}

The U.S. now has $1.4 trillion budget deficit and a $14.27 trillion debt burden. Currently, payments and interest on the debt consume more than 60 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product with the amount only expected to grow. \nThe Treasury Department predicts the country will reach its $14.29 trillion legal debt limit as early as May 16. Congress must vote to raise the debt limit within the next few weeks, or risk defaulting on debt payments. The Obama administration has said that failure to raise the debt limit will have a disastrous effect on the economy.\nLast year, President Obama appointed a debt commission which produced a plan for cutting the country's budget by $3.8 trillion, over ten years, through spending reductions and tax increases. Currently, a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats are trying to reach a compromise over this plan. But, negotiations are currently deadlocked. Congress has failed to produce a budget for fiscal year 2011, the first time it has failed to produce a budget in 36 years, leaving  the various appropriation committees no budgetary guidelines to follow.  \nS&P said, \"Because the U.S. has, relative to its AAA peers, what we consider to be very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness, and the path to addressing these is not clear to us, we have revised our outlook on the long-term rating to negative from stable.\"\nA decrease in the nation's credit rating would make it more difficult for it to borrow money, and the money it is able to borrow would come at a higher interest rate, further increasing the national debt.
