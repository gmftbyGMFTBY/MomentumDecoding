Our Founding Fathers are counting on us to make the necessary changes and apply the new checks and balances that they knew we would have to one day set in place.

Before anyone tries to say I am going to create a system of free loaders, I will state that I am calling for the utilization of resources that are costing tax dollars and still yet remain to be processed. The United States Government as taught in colleges and even some high schools across the country, are paying many land owners subsidies to not grow crops or raise livestock on their fields and these lands lay dormant. All that money is spent in the name of controlling our economy which in reality, our government has very little or no control over anyway. Tragically, part of the reason we are in this mess is because we already have too many people getting paid to do nothing. Ironically enough, it is those people who usually harass others about not doing enough to progress the workload of our country and vote to try and deny benefits to those who are legitimately injured working dangerous or difficult jobs. It would be far more effective to get a little bit out of everyone over driving those who are working into early graves. With the private distribution of wealth manipulating housing, food, career opportunity and medical costs it is no wonder not everyone is having their needs met. The U.S Human Expedition would use volunteers out in the fields we have paid an overabundance to do nothing with to feed the hungry and show the world that our strength is supported by compassion. I cannot stress enough that our government should not be passing this opportunity onto religious organizations. The Expedition would offer dorms or apartments to get people off the streets and allow those who have been struggling against poverty to stabilize themselves and stand on their own feet once more or even for the first time. With the U.S. Human Expedition in place and in co-operation with President Obama's health care plan, insurance underwriters will not have the chance to deny someone life over frivolous paperwork errors and those with pre-existing conditions will not face a lapse in care. During the transition, the U.S. Human Expedition will have experts assigned to cases where legitimate claims are denied in the name of money. At one point the military may be in control of medical care so the private distribution of wealth cannot over capitalize on an individual's right to live at the choke point of medical needs and force the inability to fulfill the unrealistic demands of such monetary costs. In many situations, spouses have spent themselves into homelessness trying to save their dying life partner.

Food charities collecting donations around the country also use the alarming statistic that at least one out of every six people of the United States is facing hunger. With over 15% of our population facing hunger and likely not having much income; if any, that turns to counter-productive aspects of life to find a means to an end. As a result of the poverty-based variables around hunger and homelessness increasingly rising, so is our crime rate just as many law enforcement budgets across the country are being dangerously cut back. The private distribution of wealth through corporations constantly motivate their higher level employees or executives to find ways to undercut the bottom dollar and make their profit margins look bigger even if they actually are not. They show no mercy when it comes to their own promotions even though it affects so many more who are positioned below them. The more this happens the faster this effect spreads throughout local and state economies.

Level one is a basic camp at first where people can go to at least get a meal a few times a day and maybe even sleep on cots or in sleeping bags inside tents. A level one checkpoint prepares for level two if the checkpoint is cleared to become a permanent location and construction based volunteers begin building new shelter. Level two checkpoints are when a building is established such as an apartment or dorm. Each level two checkpoint will also have a kitchen in it so people have a nearby place to go for their meals. Supply missions will bring in goods to checkpoints to keep them up and running. Domestic checkpoint supply missions will usually just by delivery trucks like how we do business normally bringing in supplies to restaurants and stores. In more rural areas or more threatening environments around the world when we expand out, supply missions will come with heavier risk. A level three checkpoint is not much different from level two, level three checkpoints will be a supply depot or focal point to a smaller town or village. If a checkpoint is ready to expand beyond level three it will simply become a base and will have everything that would come with being on a military installation. Expedition bases will all cultivate their own resources at one point. Police departments would have detachments out of the domestic bases and work with liaisons to make sure the peace is being kept during distribution and in living environments provided by the federal government. Any criminal activity engaged in on federal property would be a federal offense like any other federal facility. If the Department of Defense saw it fit to change some non-combative M.O.S.s over to the Human Expedition, it may make us more welcoming in places we already occupy. We can if approved by the right authorities create overseas checkpoints in such areas to see how people warm up to the new way of us doing things. Once we have secured 90% of our domestic population from poverty and have a few successful outreach checkpoints established, we will shift into the beginning of phase three.

Due to the level of secrecy and corruption involved in participating factions, we must consider that we are being misled. Many fail to realize that what is preached as the word of the \"Lord\" is not in fact what the word is. Knowing the truth and lying about it without reason is treason to your fellow people. I personally seriously doubt that Jesus Christ as wise as he was, claimed he was the \"Son of God\". Christ would not have become the Savior of Humanity through his actions but his message. I would bet my bottom dollar that Christ said that \"God\", through each and everyone one of us had divided up it's power among us. The ability to create and stand in it's image is our gift from it. Jesus was crucified because he told us to have faith in each other and that together we would have the power to save ourselves. That even in his mortal absence he would be with us every step of the way because he had faith in us. That we did not need to believe in him because he believed in us. It is said that \"God\" is made perfect in our weakness, which subliminally means that it can only be made perfect again when the world and humanity work together to achieve a common means in life. The fact that the Bible does not have any of Christ's own hand written word speaks volumes about the teachings at hand. There is also a reason in the revelations of Christ written by \"John the Baptist\" that it says that six of the seven named churches are not up to par with how the word is supposed to be served. I would wager that not a single one of them are.

All that he had tried to guard her from, all that he had feared came to light that day, as young Emily's life energy was transferred to William. Poor Emily's lifeless body fell to the ground, as William stared on in horror as his only friend died. Of course no one could find William at fault, and the girl's death was ruled an undiagnosed fatal medical condition, but poor young William knew the truth, and was forced to live with the guilt that comes with taking a life. It was at that time that his parents found me, and relocated from Charleston to the area. He was immediately pulled from school and hidden away here by his parents out of fear that if Sironian officials found out about the incident, then they would all be killed.

The level of dementia is recognised as having great relevance on deciding whether therapeutic lying is appropriate or not. The acceptability of therapeutic lying is recognised to be a complex issue and its use depends on a number of factors, including who is lying, the relationships involved, the motive behind the lie, the nature of the lie and the understanding and capacity of the person with dementia and their stage in the disease process. Of particular significance is the apparent high prevalence of therapeutic lying despite the fact that a review of the codes of professional conducts state that the practitioner must tell the truth.

At the heart of carers' actions was the intention to benefit the person with dementia. They identified an individualised approach, tailored to the person's needs and life history as being critical[1]. Such an approach they felt was not compatible within a system of hard and fast rules on \"what to do\". In the context of the actions that formal carers should take, carers saw that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them.

A key requirement for making these judgements is that carers must know the person with dementia including their preferences and know what their families think. In the context of nursing home care the detailed life history of the person with dementia is considered crucial to this process. Consequently the governance structure within which practitioners are working must take cognisance of this and focus on capacity development for carers through training and education as opposed to creating a prescriptive model of care.

This in itself could be considered truthful because it responds to the actual concerns of the person with dementia rather than what is being said (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009).

Strategies include both the person with dementia and their carer retreating together into the past, and in doing so, experiencing the lived and more vivid experiences of the person with dementia. Feil (1993) contends that living in the past is not as demanding of the person with dementia as it concentrates on their preserved abilities, i.e., their ability to recall past memories. In contrast to living in an unfamiliar present, retreating to a familiar past is far more pleasing and less stressful for the person with dementia (Douglas et al. 2004). According to Kitwood (1997), validation therapy is recognised as offering a good level of empathy with the intention of understanding a person's entire frame of reference. However, researchers argue that, like many psychosocial interventions advocated for use in dementia care, validation therapy does not have a definitive theoretical underpinning and the evidence to support its use stems largely from observational studies. These studies report that, validation therapy promotes better communication and interaction between the carer and person with dementia; it has a positive effect on behavioural symptoms and enhances the quality of life of both carer and person with dementia (Bleathman & Morton, 1988; Babins, 1998). However, converse to findings arising from qualitative studies, evidence from the most recent Cochrane systematic review (Neal & Wright, 2003), evaluating the effectiveness of validation therapy for people with dementia concludes that there is inadequate evidence to support the use of validation therapy for people with dementia. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review but because of the diversity in duration of treatment, lack of comparability between control groups and outcome measurements, pooled analysis was not feasible.

A white lie therefore is one not intended to harm the receiver. In reality it is often intended to benefit the receiver or make them feel good. However white lies are not without harm.

Autonomy centres on the person's right to self-determination and the carer's role in promoting independence for the purpose of realising self-determination (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Beneficence is about making decisions that are in the best interest of the person with dementia and non-maleficence is about minimising harm to the person with dementia (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Therapeutic lying can threaten a person's autonomy when it is used to deny the voice of the person with dementia in their care whilst only achieving short term goals such as reducing agitation (Brannelly and Whitewood (2014). However, therapeutic lying may be considered acceptable when non-maleficence and compassion are its motives (Sperber 2014; Stubbs, 2013; Tuckett, 2012). It is also important to consider the impact of therapeutic lying on the carer. Trust is a moral principle of care, and lying compromises the trusting relationship between the person with dementia and their carer (Feil & Altman, 2004; Schermer, 2007; Barnes & Brannelly, 2008). This behaviour/action may therefore have a negative impact on the carer who may feel uncomfortable with the deception and the associated impact on their integrity (Schermer, 2007). The literature also highlights that the stage of dementia is an important consideration when deciding to use therapeutic lying. Taylor (2007), writing from the perspective of the person with dementia, asserts that lying is not acceptable to people in the early stages of dementia as it heightens that disconnect that they experience from reality. However as dementia progresses and capacity diminishes, the less possible it becomes for the person with dementia to entertain beliefs, either false or true. Schermer (2007) purports that lying to someone requires a capacity to hold beliefs about what is true and what is not, thus making it conceptually impossible to lie to someone in an advanced state of dementia. If a person is not aware of being 'lied' to due to memory loss, the 'deception' may be viewed as less threatening and potentially beneficial (Kartalova-O'Doherty et al. 2014).

(2006) explored the use of therapeutic lying using an exploratory survey of staff (n =112) working in residential homes, elderly mentally ill units and hospital wards from the United Kingdom (UK) and ROI. They found that the majority of health professionals (96.5%) reported that they lied to residents with dementia. Over half the staff (51.1%) used lying to promote compliance and to benefit staff and save time (30.2%). Likewise, Culley et al. (2013) found that of the 29 psychiatrists surveyed on the use of therapeutic lying, the majority (69%) reported they had lied to people with dementia when it was deemed to be in the best interests of the person. Elvish et al. (2010) also found that lying was more acceptable to health care professionals when the focus was to reduce harm to the person with dementia. Their study used a two phased design, the first of which involved developing and piloting the attitudes towards lying to people with dementia (ALPD) questionnaire; and the second aimed at validating the questionnaire at a workshop. In phase one, participants (n=151), including psychologists, nurses, care workers and social workers, were asked to complete the newly developed questionnaire. Results showed that lying was considered more acceptable when it was in the person's best interest or to prevent injury as opposed to being used for the purpose of compliance. Tuckett (2012) also found lying was used by nurses and allied health professionals (n=18) caring for people with dementia for the purpose of eliminating harm and to control behaviour. In this study, the consequences of lying were important as identified by the concept of 'settling' a resident by lying to them. Participants identified validating the person with dementia's reality as benevolent lying as opposed to 'out and out' lying. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that professional guidelines and codes of conduct do not support lying to patients irrespective of cognitive status health professionals report that lying to people with dementia is an approach they use (Culley et al. 2013; Tuckett 2012, Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009; James et al. 2006)\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "Few studies have explored people with dementia's perceptions of lying.

Green (2015) in her unpublished Masters thesis interviewed carers to explore the impact of therapeutic lying or therapeutic fibbing. All participants had experience of caring for the person with dementia from diagnosis to the advanced stage. The findings found that carers overwhelmingly supported the use of therapeutic lying. For them the benefits of reducing or preventing emotionally upsetting or agitated situations for the person with dementia outweighed any ethical or moral concerns. Most carers also focused on the value of therapeutic lying in improving and benefiting the person with dementia rather than the impact on themselves.

These encounters she argues can result in one of two outcomes: the promotion of dignity or the violation of dignity. Dignity violation is more likely to result from an encounter in which there is a power imbalance with one person placed in a position of vulnerability due for example to cognitive impairment as in the case of the person with dementia. The impact is further exacerbated when the other actor is not sympathetic due to prejudice, personality or ignorance. The setting in which encounters take place can also exacerbate the situation. So-called harsh environments that fail to take account of the diversity of users, serve to reinforce distance and power imbalances. Jacobson (2009) characterises these settings as hierarchal and inflexible characterised by stress and a sense of urgency but deficient in resources. The people working in such environments are less likely to be empathetic to others and are also more likely to perceive questioning or non-cooperation as an 'attack on their dignity'. Being in a 'position' of vulnerability is at the core of dignity violation. This vulnerability may stem from internal factors such as physical disability, and/or cognitive impairment and external factors such as lack of knowledge or skills.\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "This review found that in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, America, Australia and the Republic of Ireland there are no official guidelines for health professionals on the", "reference_text": " best approach to take when working with persons with dementia who ask questions or make statements that are false.

A small lie (for example, reframing, distracting or moving the conversation on) was acceptable, whereas a blatant lie with the intention to fool or manipulate the person was not acceptable.

Other researchers have also reported this finding (Culley et al. 2013; Tuckett 2012; James et al. 2006). In this study the circumstances included: a more advanced stage of dementia; that the motivation behind the 'lie' is to do good and reduce harm; that the intention of the carer was to optimise autonomy, quality of life and reduce distress; that the person telling the therapeutic lie knows the person with dementia and was cognisant of family preferences. Similarly, literature focused on health care professionals perspectives found that therapeutic lying was considered acceptable when non-maleficence and compassion were the intentions (Kartalova-O'Doherty et al. 2014; Sperber 2014; Stubbs, 2013; Tuckett, 2012; Elvish et al. 2010). Codes of conduct, ethical and best practice guidelines for healthcare professionals however stress the need for truth telling and stipulate that lying to patients is inappropriate. There is an apparent discrepancy therefore between the findings of this study, other research literature and professional codes of practice and ethics which clearly outline that lying in any form is inappropriate and unacceptable.\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "Our study found that people with dementia and informal/unpaid carers believed that therapeutic lying was acceptable under the same circumstances as those described by health care professionals.", "reference_text": " Again these findings are supported by other literature that explored the perspective of people with dementia (Green et al. 2015; Day et al. 2011; Taylor 2007). Informal/unpaid carers were influenced by the capacity of the person with dementia and were more likely to tell the truth in the earlier stages and lie by omission or avoidance in the later stages of the disease. They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. At the heart of informal/unpaid carers actions was the intention to benefit the person with dementia and they reported that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. A few informal/unpaid carers in the current study reported that they sometimes felt uncomfortable 'lying' to the person with dementia as it might increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship. However, similar to the findings in (Green 2015), it appeared that the benefits of reducing upset for the person with dementia offset these concerns. The use of therapeutic lying therefore in instances when people with dementia who ask questions or make statements that are false is, similar to the literature, deemed to be an acceptable strategy both by health professionals, informal/unpaid carers and people with dementia.

Therefore, they were wary given the unique needs of each person with dementia, of having specific rules and guidelines to follow in relation to which strategy to choose. Similar to the health professionals they felt that irrespective of the strategies used educating carers on their use should be a pre-requisite to implementation. Similarly to the informal/unpaid carers people with dementia were less concerned with the name given to the different strategies as long as the strategies used were respectful, mindful of the person's dignity and autonomy and self-esteem. In this context, acceptable approaches included therapeutic lying as well as the use of distraction and avoiding the false statement or question asked. Participants were clear that the dignity of the person with dementia must never be undermined and highlighted the importance of trust in relationships and the importance of carers taking time to get to know and understand the person. Such encounters have the potential to promote dignity (Jacobson 2012). The environment where two people meet is also important. If the person with dementia does not feel safe and secure then the potential for violation of dignity is increased. Finally, the policy and social context, within which encounters take place, has a major influence on whether encounters will promote or violate dignity. It is imperative therefore that the context of care provision for people with dementia is unhurried, non-hierarchical and flexible, so that dignity can be promoted and nurtured (Jacobson 2012).\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "In conclusion there were no major conflicts or differences of opinion among people with dementia, informal/unpaid carers and health professionals in the context of the best approach", "reference_text": " to take when people with dementia ask questions or make statements that are false. The consensus is that there is no single approach that will suit each person or be appropriate every time. Rather than prescriptive guidelines carers should undertake an individualised assessment that enables a judgement to be made as to the best approach to take in any given context A key requirement for making these judgements is that carers must know the person with dementia including their preferences and know what their families think. In the context of nursing home care the detailed life history of the person with dementia is considered crucial to this process. Consequently the governance structure within which practitioners are working must take cognisance of this and focus on capacity development for carers through training and education as opposed to creating a prescriptive model of care. It is also clear that a discrepancy exists between respective health professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines and health professionals use of therapeutic lying, which is an alternative approach to truth telling or correcting the person with dementia. This has serious practical implications for health professionals.

More immediately it would help take the edge off the dark and chill of the approaching night.

Next he gathered together dandelion heads, dried grass and twigs of varying sizes, even using the sharp edge of an obsidian flake to shave kindling off a larger stick, and laid them out on the ground by the cave in preparation. He then spent the better part of an hour and a half in frustration, striking the flints at different angles and in different ways over the tinder until a single spark finally took hold.

That sun was small and sharp but very intense and would be fully exposed within seconds with the aid of a rapidly spinning world.

This one was larger and softer and took several minutes before its full disk was visible. He could recall its like from much deeper in the recesses of his mind. It was, when he forced his mind back, much more like Sol, the sun that had shone over Earth - the planet of his birth. For a moment the memory of sunrise on Earth displaced more recent recollections, drawing him back through decades, through centuries of time to the last time he had seen it, or indeed anything like it. That image had not been so clear to his thoughts for longer than he cared to contemplate. Sitting atop the cliffs of Dover watching the sun appear over the English Channel just as it was appearing now over this alien sea. Within hours he would be making the final preparations to leave Earth for good. The choice had been a deliberate one, made with full knowledge of what it meant, but was no less emotional for that. He'd forced himself to suppress as much of that emotion as he could for the sake of a smooth transition to a new life, pushing aside anything that might make him regret the decision. Now it seemed circumstance had pulled those memories to the surface once more. So vivid were they that a thought began to form in his mind, starting as a question and expanding rapidly to a doubt that was not easily shaken off. A sun like Earth's sun, lighting a day the duration of Earth's day, with air and water and plants and animals just like those of Earth. Might it be that his expected purpose had been abandoned after all?

The shifting streaks of white and grey which varied in pattern and coverage over the course of days, or sometimes hours, from complete saturation to near absence and everything in between, he had long ago recognised as banks of cloud and systems of weather. He had seen clouds often enough, both from the surface of a planet that produced them and from far above it, to know what they looked like \\- the way they flow and swirl and change their shape and distribution, the variations in density and whiteness.

They looked like nothing so much as dark green continents on dark red seas - or perhaps vice versa.

These patterns remained rigidly stationary, not only in relation to each other as would be expected of fixed landmarks, but with respect to him as well, indicating that Lune from his perspective did not spin at all. Both bodies orbited and rotated in perfect lock-step, each one showing the same face to the other at all times. Of course he had noted these things many times since the first time he had seen that face, but now that he was seeing it entirely he felt a renewed urgency in his contemplation of them. And the more he contemplated it the more he began to suspect, aside the dismal and foreboding impression its dark countenance would at first invoke, that Lune was in fact a vital and living place.

If he felt like sleeping or his horse needed rest that was the time to do it, knowing it would be a good few hours before the path ahead became visible again. But as the lunar crescent waxed towards fullness the surrounding landscape gradually brightened once more until by the small hours of the morning the surrounding countryside could be seen in complete, if slightly off coloured detail.

In its wake the variegated light-on-dark texture of the surface vanished deep into shadow. When it reached the lower edge the sky was about as dark as it ever got. Now the only visible thing was a faint penumbral ring where the bright full moon had hung only an hour before, prominent only in contrast to the otherwise totality of darkness. Occasionally a thunderstorm would be visible as brief flashes of light here and there on the black surface, and curved ribbons of colour circling the poles to the left and right revealed the presence of aurorae. At other times, when the surface was especially clear of clouds, he thought he could make out fainter and more stable points of light, as if stars had been moved from where they should have been to where they shouldn't - as if the lunar face had become a portal to a more normal part of space. Try as he might to resist he could not help but speculate, with just a glimmer of hope, about what those points of light might represent. Each of these observations offered a hint, albeit a tantalisingly small one, to what kind of a world that was.

There was the Great Mid Range, a prominent variation in the colour of Grand Australis which divided it neatly into western and eastern halves, and which he took to be a range of tall mountains because of the way it seemed to influence the flow of clouds, and the way it played with the passing terminator which separated night from day on that world.\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "There was also an odd little blemish that he had initially overlooked, but which had come to hold a particular fascination.

Of course that was difficult to know for sure given its small size, but it seemed to lack the irregular border of other surface features giving it an unnatural appearance. Secondly, it sat very neatly on the divide between two of the major masses of near black - the dark green of Grand Australis on the left, and the even larger mass of dark red to the right, which was north. Whatever those colour variations might signify, that placement seemed to be purposeful. Like the Mid Range mountains far off to the south-west, it appeared to have an effect on the patterns of cloud and weather around it, and looked to be casting a particularly long shadow at the appropriate times of day when conditions were clear enough to see it. Moreover when the clouds in its vicinity were calm it often even appeared above them, a clear brown dot on a field of white. All of this suggested its true size was very large for such an isolated thing. And when the surrounding surface was darkened by shadow or night, it was that spot which most often marked concentrations of faint points of light nearby. Finally there were recent measurements which placed it almost, but not quite, at the very centre of the disk from his point of view, and subsequent very rough calculations suggesting the deviation was more due to his own position than its.

But a shimmer on the distant ground had broadened from what might have been a mirage to an unmistakable body of water, and by midday he was standing on a shore that extended as far as he could see to the north and south, and overlooked a clean blue rippling surface at least as far as the western horizon.

He considered a number of possible explanations for this - maybe it was being diluted by the delta of a freshwater river nearby, or maybe this planet's oceans did not comply with his expectation of them, or maybe, just maybe, this was after all only a large lake, its slight salinity just incidental run-off from the surrounding plain. What's more there was life here - mussels clinging to the rocky shallows and some good sized trout skimming the underside of the surface just offshore. And life meant food enough for an extended investigation. He stripped off and jumped into the water to freshen his skin and wash the dust and salt out of his hair.

Certainly going south had been a good choice - the detour had been an easy one. The terrain was mostly level and reasonably free of obstructions, and fresh water streams often drained into the lake, and sources of food were abundant along the shore in that direction. There were frequent groves of tropical fruiting trees - bananas and mangos, even pineapples - and he was occasionally successful in pulling a feed of fish from the lake itself. Once again he was struck by the diversity of life that had come to infest this world and had managed to adapt to it.

He knew immediately what this was and what it signified. This was lumina, and its presence in the river was a sure indication that somewhere nearby, most probably upstream, another terramine, like the one he had found at the source of the Swift River, was actively engaged in the process by which a planet not naturally suited to habitability was made so by artificial means.

It was a craving he had denied and suppressed as a matter of necessity as he made his way through a landscape rich with nature at its most primitive, or showing signs of alien machinations far removed from what he found comfortable.

Even if he'd not heard it he would surely have felt it. And this one was certainly still active. Water still swirled and bubbled through huge flat tanks, and faint whiffs of vapour rose into the air from numerous pipes and chimneys. But it was showing signs of slowing down.

The whole area was liberally peppered with oases which he would encounter every few days, just as he was starting to wonder if he'd seen the last of them.

That suggested an answer, albeit inconclusive, to a question that he'd posed immediately on arrival the previous day. There was a chance this body of water, like the Great Lake encountered nine months earlier, was just an inland sea. That was part of what this current exploration was aimed at finding out.

They would likely have affected the land as well, producing earthquakes and volcanoes and other geological activity, reducing habitability further still.

Much of his childhood had been spent fishing or swimming or canoeing on the dams and lakes around his home or on seaside holidays with his parents, but he could only remember that now in the vaguest of images that seemed to belong to someone else. On OldEarth he had also spent time fishing from a dinghy along the shores of the Great Lake near his home in Southhaven, as had most of his neighbours there. On Kruger there were only small, isolated bodies of murky, muddy, lifeless water, but even these could be enjoyed in a small boat if that was the mood. There, where the sun never moved in the sky, one could loose hours at a time without realising it. Even Aurigae, not so much a world as a vast flotilla of artificial habitats orbiting a star, had been made homely with water features, some of which were veritable oceans.

Not only one, but several - many - swimming to and fro around him - a veritable school of large sharks. The place seemed to be infested with them. Another knock. They were not being aggressive, just curious - but a curious shark, he knew, was not much less worrying than an angry one. A dorsal fin breached ominously beside the boat's starboard.

There were several of them along the waterline, and he aimed at the nearest, intermittently paddling and bailing water with his hands, reaching it with, he guessed, minutes before foundering entirely. The platform was situated some height above the level of the water, low enough to climb if he stood in the canoe, but impossible to reach from treading water, and with no handholds or moorings on the smooth white vertical face of the wall. It would be a delicate balancing act and he knew he only had one shot. He hurled his belongings one by one over the lip, then, in a single motion, quickly but carefully leapt from the canoe and clambered to safety.

The walls were white and featureless, a continuation of the material forming the rest of the surroundings, except for a single small protuberance on one side which had the appearance of a button that wanted pressing. He did press it and watched with considerable delight as the entire tunnel lit up with a soft white light emitted from sections of translucent faux wall along its length.

In his mind he was drawn back to times he had lived for decades in claustrophobic conditions, parts of which had been every bit as tight and confining as where he was now.

Something about keeping a respectable distance, about leaving unascended humans to exercise their own intellect as far as possible. In the past he was occasionally able to access intermediaries - demigods and priests and specially designated experts who could aid with the translations and help bridge the gap.

He was feeling satisfied after a restful night's sleep that had followed the first proper meal he'd had in many days. Prior to that food had been foremost on his mind. It would not do, he had told himself as he searched with growing desperation, to survive ten thousand kilometres of wilderness only to die of starvation in a structure clearly build as a dwelling place for his kind. It turned out that food, like anything, was not difficult to find if you knew where to look. Where to look was in the outskirts of the City along the inside of the perimeter wall - the rural hinterland. That made sense in hindsight, but in truth it was only on a whim that he had decided to explore along the outermost border to the north. It was there he had found an entire region of low structures lush with a huge variety of food items growing from the walls and roofs and corners and hollows. Moreover it was evident that this growth was not purely incidental - these were not weeds that had simply taken root there like much of the vegetation elsewhere in the City. There were kinds of food here that he had seen nowhere else on NewEarth - exotic vegetables and hybrid fruits that combined a variety of forms and flavours, and chicken meat, and slabs of beef bark extruded from the walls and floor - artificial, engineered raw ingredients specifically designed to sustain the primitive human form and culture in an artificial world, far removed from its original home.

The find was important to him because his activities would no longer be restricted to daylight hours, and if he was honest he found the dark times in the City rather unnerving - even under the light of Lune.

Rather, it appeared to support a single rail not dissimilar to transportation systems he had known from previous lives. It continued in both directions as a track suspended from a series of tall pylons extending for as far as he could follow it. Intrigued and hopeful he scanned along what length he could see and, sure enough, found what appeared to be a carriage of sorts hanging from the rail at a height above the ground and some distance away.

The juxtaposition of elements so obviously pointed to one particular conclusion that he barely hesitated in pushing the lever forward. As it happened his assumption proved entirely correct. A light shower of dust shook free from the rail overhead and fell around him, as though this was the first time the mechanism had operated in decades, but it nevertheless lurched instantly to life and the carriage down the track sped away at a considerable pace.

This time the wheel turned effortlessly. It took far more force to push the door open, and only when the extended rush of outflowing air began to hurt his eardrums did he have the first inkling that this might not have been a sensible idea.

After trying the former approach for many minutes without success he had noted down all the relevant parameters and returned to his study to work on the problem at leisure. He found it intriguing that the Hosts had wanted to test his grasp of mathematical abstraction in this way. It was also rather fortunate that he possessed the required skills to pass the test. As a younger man he had never been especially good at, or interested in, mathematics. It was only later, much later in life, during a period when he was studying disciplines of all kinds as a substitution for gainful employment, that its wonders had been opened up to him. He had been fascinated by its ability to describe, in the purest terms, truths that applied to the dirty details of mundane life, and to establish connections between parts of reality that were otherwise wholly unrelated. He was especially fascinated by the perennially open question of whether it was a discipline that would be discovered by minds that had evolved independently of humanity.

For all of history prior to that discovery, human beings, for all they knew with any certainty, might very well have been alone in the cosmos.

That news had reached him only later as it criss crossed the expanding bubble of human occupation at the snail's pace of light speed. Most noteworthy of all were the signs, so faint across the great gulf of intergalactic space that they could be discerned at all only by vast instruments, and even then only at the limits of resolution of those instruments, of activity by an intelligence on par with that of humanity in a galaxy some thirteen million light-years distant. In spite of their weakness it had been demonstrated beyond any reasonable expression of doubt that intelligent activity was the cause of those signs.

He could still, even after all the intervening time, put names and occasional faces to some of those companions - Fritz-Biscane who was thin and wiry and understood exo-biochemistry and abiogenesis, and Tulley, exactly the opposite in appearance who had studied the evolutionary history of both terrestrial and non-terrestrial life.

With the pressures equalised he pulled the door wide open and gingerly took the first step onto an alien surface.\n", "generated_result": {"0": " "}}, {"prefix_text": "He was standing on an open field of dark green sponge, so dark it was nearly black, that gave only slightly under his feet but otherwise easily supported his weight", "reference_text": ". Immediately he was reminded of the floor material in the hubs of each of the three pipe habitats he had found on NewEarth, lending further credence to his suspicion as to what those structures were. The spongy ground covering stretched almost unbroken, save for a few outcroppings of dull grey or orange rock, as far as he could see in several directions where it formed rolling hills in the distance to the right. To the left it sloped down until it disappeared beneath a shore of gently lapping waves. The line of the shore extended in front of him into a coast of black topped cliffs and headlands set against a grey sky. The coastline marked the border between the land on one side and an ocean, wide and flat out to the horizon, on the other. But to describe the scene in terms drawn from its terrestrial equivalent was to belie how seriously wrong it looked. Everything about this seascape was strange, even those things that were entirely familiar - the clouds shaped like the columns of an ancient temple, the soft slurping sound of the waves licking the shore, the warm breeze against his face, the pungent smells filtering through his breathing mask. And the colour. The colour was all wrong. The water as far out as he could see, if he assumed it was water, was very dark brown, differentiated from the land only by its overall flatness, the light swell on its surface and its different hue of black. It looked disgusting - polluted, as if in the aftermath of a major chemical spill, or perhaps infected by an outbreak of toxic bacteria - and he needed to consciously remind himself he had no basis on which to judge the natural beauty of this place. For all he knew that was exactly how an ocean was meant to look on this world. Further out to sea huge trees, like sheer vertical islands growing from the ocean surface, only served to add to the thoroughly alien appearance. At least they looked like trees.

He could still make out enough of it from this vantage to gauge its size and unnatural symmetry, jutting out into the ocean like a peninsular. A long straight ribbon, tapered by perspective into a thin wire that vanished in its direction, marked the outside of the tunnel he had traversed over the previous days - sometimes partially buried by a low hill, sometimes supported by struts to preserve straightness as it bridged a shallow valley. He noticed that the tunnel end and access hatch were covered in what seemed to be a scaffold of thin sticks and twigs.

They looked like dark clouds sitting low to the ground, fixed in place but in constant motion - gyrating, pulsating, expanding and contracting. Not smoothly or simply, but neither randomly nor in representation of any object he could identify save for vague abstract ones - spirals and helices coiling and uncoiling like springs, origami artworks folding and unfolding, monocoloured fireworks bursting to two or three times their smallest size before collapsing down to a compact lump.

The water, which looked so dirty from a distance, was actually crystal clear, its dark tinge due to it containing a continuous mass of slender strands, like brunette hair that waved to and fro in the currents just beneath the surface. If that was universally the source of the colour, then the whole ocean must have been full of the stuff. He made a move to put his hand into the water with a view, among other things, to letting it cool his skin - it was, after all, stiflingly hot here compared to the interior of the tunnel - but pulled back, suddenly aware of what he should have realised the whole time. He did not know what toxins or pathogens existed in this alien water. Or, for that matter, in the air. His lungs were protected by the mask from the more elementary difference in atmospheric composition, but large areas of skin were still exposed. What was worse, he may have been carrying viruses and bacteria of his own that would endanger this environment. He had assumed, without even giving it conscious thought, that his Hosts would not have compelled him to come here, would not have provided the means for his transport to this planet and his survival while on it, without adequately protecting him from its more subtle dangers, and vice versa.

So he had set out on a trek back to the Fabricator with the purpose of producing a more suitable set of clothes, and also to construct a bicycle that would make further explorations easier on his feet.

Overhead the ghostly face of NewEarth, seen by nothing more than the faint glint of its own albedo, was the only source of illumination, and even that faded as the peak of noon approached.

Further out he could see others rising out of the ocean like islands, and to the south the distant coast shimmered in a haze of heat. The deep purple colour of the sky, clear apart from a few small clouds, was more than enough to dispel any remaining temptation to feel at home here. Around the base of the rocks a gentle swell rhythmically raised and lowered the level of the water. Just below the surface the same hair-like fronds of sea grass he had seen on the coast covered the whole area of ocean for as far as he could see in all directions, concealing his view of the depths. There was no way he could tell how deep the water was - for all he knew this grass might have been hundreds of metres long or it might have come no further than his waist, not that he was willing to test it. Small eel-like creatures darted in and out among the fronds in little shoals, as did one or two larger, flatter animals. More sounds - distant squawks and chirps - drew his attention to the sky above where he could see a small formation of dark objects gliding overhead.

The water there was roiling and splashing with living activity as if a school of fish had become trapped inside. It was alive with sound as well, buzzing and scratching and occasionally a brief mournful cry echoed through the cavernous hollow, and a rich cocktail of odours wafted at him from all directions. On two or three occasions a sudden sound and movement in the corner of his eye alerted him to something falling from above.

He saw a fleshy air sack around the girth of its frame inflate and quickly collapse again as it let out a shrill cry.

Where night still had dominance the shadowy orb overhead was, if anything, closer to a normal blue than the rest of the sky.

As he looked over what he had written and thought about what he had seen that afternoon, the true significance of his situation on this planet began, as if for the first time, to penetrate into his awareness. Planets on which aboriginal life of even the simplest kind had come to exist were rare in the universe. They were known to be rare. The conditions which led to the spontaneous formation of living matter were tightly constrained, and the obstacles to its formation were numerous. And planets where aboriginal life thrived and evolved were even rarer. As a youth, living and growing on Earth, not a single instance other than Earth itself was known. Not one. Indeed by the time the first such example was confirmed in the Milky Way, the number of planets supporting relocated colonies of terrestrial life exceeded all those supporting native life that would ever be found in that galaxy. He himself had visited or occupied several worlds other than Earth, and had lived several lifetimes separated by millennia of sleep, before learning that organisms not descended from those of his own homeworld even existed. By that time the rarity of naturally occurring living ecosystems had become a point of moral concern in its own right. Such planets were afforded protection from any and all interference. For the sake of curiosity, non-terrestrial life could be studied, but only on the proviso and to the extent that the flow of information from those studies was strictly one way. Natural human senses were far too clumsy to provide any assurance to that effect, and so human flesh, in any of its forms, had never been in direct contact with any life not drawn from the ecosystems of Earth.\n", "generated_result": {"0": "\""}}, {"prefix_text": "Of course that could never be known with certainty.

The children of humankind had been mindful of this even as they spread themselves across space. They were mindful, too, of the importance of carrying their most sacred principles with them wherever they went and had devised subtle and clever schemes to ensure that it was ever the case. But within those schemes they had placed, very deliberately, a single loophole. It was an exception forced by a deep conflict between two of their own most elemental moral rules: never to interfere and always to tell the truth.

Stars and planets, which close up can seem so grand and immutable, form like raindrops in a thunderstorm and fall just as quickly. Viewed at that scale the rare becomes expected and even the unexpected will occasionally occur, and by great good fortune the first case of a technologically advanced race independent of humanity was found relatively quickly and relatively close. The plan to make optimum use of this circumstance - the only plan, put together over thousands of years and spanning the distance between galaxies - was brought into play.

Back to when the stars and the patterns they formed on the sky had only ever been seen from a single point in space and very nearly a single point in time. Back to the childhood of humanity, and to his own childhood, on Earth. There those patterns of stars appeared fixed and eternal, and because they were fixed they could be identified with names that stuck for the lifetimes of those that named them, and their children, and their grandchildren. They were named for animals - lions and bulls and scorpions. They were named for people - hunters and maidens and water bearers. They were named for things - scales and crosses. And they were named for mythical beasts like the one with the head and chest of a human and the hindquarters of a horse - the Centaur. Even when it became known that those patterns were not fixed - not just as a theory but as the real passage of time and the shifting perspective across huge spans of space had distorted them beyond all recognition - even when the original namers had been dead for many generations - even then some part of those names could be found clinging to some of the stars and other objects that had made up the patterns originally. And so it was when the very first evidence of mind on a par with that which had long before descended from humankind was discovered and confirmed, it was discovered in a galaxy that had once occupied the pattern of the Centaur. The galaxy itself had been renamed and renumbered so often that all connection to its origin was broken. The priests of OldEarth had called it Tingard, a name whose origin was itself an entirely different story.

But the fact that he had already encountered these creatures on NewEarth was suggestive, if only he could tell what it was suggestive of.

The heap was evaporating as fast as it was formed as each individual insect, apparently not very much the worse for wear, shook itself off and rejoined its respective swarm for another run.

It was entirely possible that the modes of thinking he was accustomed to would not be adequate for that task, dealing as they were with a system of biology and cognition different from anything anyone of his kind had ever experienced. Or it might equally have a perfectly mundane explanation - some of these creatures were fearful and hateful of anything appearing in their world as new or strange while others were tolerant and accepting. Was that really so different from what might be expected of his own race - indeed what he knew to be the case from history, and had frequently observed with his own eyes? It even made sense that this would be the case. Life was fragile and its continued existence required treading the fine line marking the boundary between those circumstances necessary to maintain it, and those circumstances sufficient to extinguish it. Where the environment alone did not guarantee that line could be held, intelligence arose to force it actively, and the more delicate and complex the balancing act became, the more intelligence evolved to sustain it. The result was, perhaps, a universal - representing precisely the two attitudes that might reasonably be expected from sentient life when it encountered something new - fear and curiosity. The great conflict. On the positive side it was a sign of intelligence that individuals drawn from the same species could differ so radically in their behaviour. It suggested personality, diversity of opinion and abstraction of thought - the very traits he had come to find. But it also left him wondering how great an upheaval his arrival on this world had been for these creatures. Was it something that had been expected, even anticipated, or was it a culture shock that felt to them like an invasion? And what knowledge of him did they possess before he had appeared in front of them? Did they have any contact with the Hosts, and how were they related to the Hosts?

As he went about these explorations he was encountering and documenting - and naming - many of the local species.

The swarms were certainly able to communicate, utilising both sound and physical contact across broad regions of their expanded volume to coordinate activity and influence behaviour, and he had even had some success communicating with them himself. It had proved possible to convey simple abstract concepts by constructing geometric shapes on the ground from pebbles and sticks and having them respond by modifying those images in meaningful ways.

It seemed inappropriate to procure it as a specimen for close study, much as he wanted to do just that. So he simply looked at it from a respectful distance without touching it, noting and sketching the details of its appearance - its slightly elongated bulky body with no clear distinction between head and tail, its three groups of stubby wings, fore, mid and aft, its four circles of raised iridescent bumps front and back that he took to be compound eye spots, its several rows top and bottom of legs, or antennae, or both, the black and bright green loops and swirls like fingerprints marking the rest of its surface - and then left it where it lay. He did, on another occasion, try to briefly capture a live one by gently enclosing it in his hands, but a marked increase in the agitation of the swarm around him, more so than the singleton itself, had compelled him to quickly release it again before he'd had the chance to examine it.

The platformed hive that had attacked him was not where it had been before, but there were several others he could see at a distance in the dim light. It seemed the platforms were indeed vehicles of some sort. He walked up past Pocahontas, respectfully distant but close enough to see that while the swarm as a whole was calm, individual wasps were still quite active, moving to and fro, patterns forming and unforming in their bulk action and slowly dispersing through the visible volume of the swarm.

Blades of thick leather rose from the ground haphazardly and towered overhead like trees. There was barely enough space between them to move, and razor sharp serrated edges made it inadvisable to try. Long prehensile vines with the girth of his arm hung from many of these stalks, twisting and swaying under their own power like so many dangling snakes - very much like snakes but for the absence of clear eyes and mouth, and for the covering of fine fur which, he noted, made them look nothing like snakes at all.

The web was weak enough and the constrictions of the coiling serpent so soft that he felt he could easily extricate himself from its grasp, but the more he tried the more entangled he became. Initially the situation felt faintly ridiculous, even mildly humorous. He chuckled with private embarrassment as his left hand became stuck even while trying to pull the right hand free, then both legs became entwined as two more twisting snakes joined in the sport. It did not take too many minutes to realise this was a much more serious circumstance, particularly as the midnight eclipse reached its climax, robbing him of the sense he needed to see what he was doing.

Their grip was starting to encroach further up his chest and he was becoming fearful they would soon be wrapped around his neck and face. Carefully he reached in and drew IceNeedle from his tool belt, transferring it to his right hand for a better grip and a more convenient angle even as the wriggling serpents squeezed ever more firmly around his torso. The hairy outer skin was tough, but no match for the razor edge of his knife. Pale pink fluid gushed from the wound along with some internal structure that might have been mistaken for intestines.

With no bone to slice through it was a relatively simple process, but still took several minutes as he had to work cautiously and surgically to avoid cutting himself at such close quarters, and to limit movement that would stimulate further trammelling.

A mounted kenthoni hive was visible in the distance to the right, clearly stirring from slumber as the central swarm expanded in the light of morning, and beginning to display the intricate spirals and ripples characteristic of wakeful attention. Initially not overly worried he continued walking, though with the faint air of someone moving through a potentially hostile neighbourhood. A vibration through the ground and a rhythmic mechanical sound drew his attention back to the hive. It was no longer just the dark cloud of wasps that had become active - the rusty mount it was sitting on was billowing plumes of black smoke that quickly settled into grey wisps. It jerked from side to side once or twice and began to inch forward, its huge caterpillar treads visibly churning the ground as they started to rotate. The thing was indeed mobile as he had suspected - remarkably mobile in fact as it picked up speed - and heading in his direction. Even then he was more intrigued than concerned, but nonetheless thought it best not to wait so exposed to assess its intentions, and picked up his own pace towards the safety of the airlock. His concern grew with the realisation that a combination of his own hobbled pace and the considerable speed the vehicle had attained would easily place it between himself and his goal. To make the situation worse, long before the gap between them had closed the malleable form of the kenthoni rider began stretching itself towards him. His final faint hope that this might be a display of innocent curiosity was dashed when the swarm hit with both substantial force and deliberate intent. With astonishing precision and dexterity a volley of wasp strikes knocked him face first to the ground with well aimed blows to the back of his knees, and pinned him there by concerted attention to his legs, back and wrists - a constant stream of impacting insects delivering a continuous force that made very effective shackles. It was as if they had contemplated his possible vulnerabilities and were now testing those ideas - successfully. They proceeded then to strip the worm silk from his skin and clothes, and he briefly had an idea that they might have been trying to help him, until they started using it with great skill to bind him even further. Within minutes he was completely immobilised. The physical assault subsided enough for him to sense the vibrations through the ground becoming stronger and the mechanical throbbing of the mobile becoming louder. From his prone position he was able to see the huge vehicle coming closer, and for a terrifying moment he thought it would run right over him. But it rolled slowly past, its great metal treads mere meters from his head - close enough that he could feel the coarse clay dirt crack under the weight, close enough that he could feel greasy black lubricant from the axles splashing him, close enough that he could tell its rust red appearance was more than just a colour choice. The thing really did appear to be made of rusted iron, honed smooth and functional as a building material in its own right, but creating to his eyes the impression of great age and ongoing deterioration, as if it had been salvaged from a junkyard.

It did little to assuage this particular fear to know that such a life cycle was typically highly adapted, and not likely to even be attempted with a random species from another world.

In the previous days of observation he had not seen any sign of the eggs being laid. He was well aware that this might simply have been an observational failure on his part.

Rather they were intimately connected to it, drawing from it the energies and materials of life.

Every animate creature in this ecosystem was associated with a sessile plant body, and the association was not merely incidental.

The brief instant of startled reflex was enough to cause a crucial misstep. Vainly grasping for anything to arrest the fall, he found himself an instant later entirely submerged in a quagmire of slimy writhing bodies. Panic and disgust hit in equal measure. There might also have been a hint of annoyance at being in the one place he had sought to avoid, but it was more than overwhelmed by the realisation that the weight of his tool belt was dragging him into depths that were not known other than being certainly over his head, and that his face mask would not serve as a breathing device underwater, let alone whatever else was in this cesspit. To make matters worse, in the dark and engulfed in writhing organisms, he was quickly becoming disoriented. He thrashed violently, joining briefly the throng of creatures surrounding him, and after what felt like a terrifying eternity managed to break the surface.

He remembered there was a single hook left along with the hammer on his tool belt, and he was now grateful he'd not had the presence of mind to release it a moment earlier when it was dragging him under. With some effort he managed to pound the hook into the bark far enough under the surface to provide a rest for one foot, smashing several barkfish in the process and spilling their insides into the muck around him, before inadvertently letting the hammer slip from his fingers and into the dark depths. Even with that support he tried and failed several times to reach the rope, every attempt bringing him closer to the exhaustion and muscle fatigue he knew was to be avoided if he was to keep any gains he made. It was only by digging IceNeedle into the bark and hoisting against it that he was able to gain the few additional inches needed to take hold of the knotted end of the rope.

It had not escaped his notice that, unlike humans whose minds were enclosed in a bony skull, the mind of a kenthoni was open for all to see - even him. Their whole system of interaction and communication was based on a kind of telepathy - not the spurious kind that utilised mysterious forces, but the kind that required little more than simply watching a peer as a thought was formed in their mind. He had wondered if this natural ability might have given them a significant edge when developing the technology to become a spacefaring race. How, he had also wondered, did that make his own race appear by comparison - hidden and secretive and unworthy of trust?

His movement in that direction provoked an immediate response. Within seconds streams of wasps were striking him with considerable cumulative force, pushing him back from his goal. But this attack was different from the others. Small jabs of sharp pain through his clothes and against his exposed skin suggested, to his horror, that some of these wasps were stinging him. With little chance of getting to the door under this onslaught he turned and ran to the shore, using his pack to shield his head and neck, and jumped in without hesitating, immersing himself in the water.

In the melee that ensued it was difficult to differentiate between the swarms, and the typical ordered harmony that characterised their bulk activity gave way to the kind of chaotic confusion that might have been expected of a large number of disturbed insects.

A number of appendages like branches or tufts of thick hair protruded from near the top, curled over the sides and extended into the sponge bed. Though the colour was different its overall appearance reminded him of what he had found at the heart of the Jimitry back on NewEarth years earlier. But while that one had been dead and desiccated and shrivelled up, this one looked much more vital and alive, albeit entirely sessile - firmly rooted to the spongy ground around it and showing neither the means nor the inclination to movement.

He had not encountered that before, and he noticed the kenthoni wasps busying themselves gathering surprisingly large chunks of it and dropping them into hoppers around the hull of the vehicle. They crossed over and ran beside trails left by other mobiles - some freshly scarred and broken, some showing varying amounts of regrowth as indicated by lighter shades of green, others fully re-established but still deeply furrowed - as if this was a well travelled transport route. They passed both near and far to other kenthoni hives, some alone and others in groups of three or four or even five. All the while the huge conical spire of the Mountain, fixed to the skyline on the right hand side as they moved forward, at least provided a comforting hint of the familiar.

The whole thing was constantly rumbling and vibrating in a coarse low bass as it moved, and vents along the side exuded frequent puffs of vapour and dribbles of liquid. He also noted that many of the wasps busied themselves constantly picking up scraps of pulverised sponge grass from the ground as they passed, shredding it further with their own bodies and feeding it into openings an the back. The same was done with further supplies of the blue crystal that they passed. Possibly a fuel source, he thought. Beyond that he had no idea how the structure moved. He could see what he took to be the manual controls for accelerating, breaking and steering - long metal bars rotating on a central pivot, like see-saws, permanently attended by collections of wasps that could, by finely coordinated group action, manipulate them with surprising delicacy.

He had arrived in the midst of a civil war - or possibly his arrival had triggered it. It was also clear that this world was not the place of origin of the kenthoni, but a colonial world constructed by the Hosts and twinned with his own terrestrial habitat, set up to reflect the original form of two respective races - like a diorama in a museum - captured at the moment each had become a spacefaring civilisation. They were meant to be together, so the conflict he was unwittingly creating was more widespread than was even apparent at first glance. And there were still larger mysteries here. The kenthoni colony was by some measures the better established of the two and should therefore have been a better representation of that moment in their history. One of only two species known to have attained an interstellar presence was, by nature, rooted to a single place on the ground, and needed a sophisticated piece of technology just to become nomadic.

Evolution had somehow managed to construct a mind with the capacity to understand the entire universe from the very smallest particle of matter to superclusters of galaxies, from the very earliest moment of time to its eventual end in cold, diffuse emptiness. Scales of existence that had no bearing on parochial tooth and claw survival and adaptability, the guiding hands by which evolution sculpted its forms, somehow managed to be included in the results. But to evolve a mind able to understand itself, that had always seemed too great a feat to ask. So for much of humanity's push to understand the universe in which it existed, the mind itself was not thought part of that universe. From that error had arisen various forms of superstition and religion and spurious philosophy that had continued to influence human thinking and delay human progress even well into his own early days. That idea had long ago been proven to be untrue, but the human mind had certainly not evolved to understand itself. Indeed it had always been imagined that it could not have evolved to understand itself. Eventually the understanding of mind by mind was achieved, but at the cost of being by something other than evolved humans themselves. Rather, it was the artificial progeny of natural humans, beings with minds designed to think in different ways who had attained that goal.

They began diving towards the pile and colliding with each other in pairs with such force that each of the pair was left momentarily stunned on the ground. At each collision he heard a pronounced click that seemed inconsistent with their soft bodies, until he realised that each was carrying with it a pebble or a shard of stone.
